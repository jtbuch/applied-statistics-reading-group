    "This is introduced in (Hopfield 1982) as a solution to a problem of finding a physical system that has \"general content-adressable memory\" with some error forgiveness. To the best I can gather (I was and remain largely unfamliar with the term), a content-adressable memory system provides a fast method of retrieving a memory or information packet from a lookup table. A a <i>general</i> content addressable memory system is described as a system that can retreive a full memory from partial information. \n",

It was pointed out that the number of possible states is on the order of $2^N$ and that may reflect the order of necessary samples. I argue that need not be true (with much gusto though little confidence). While there is some degree of stochasticity in this system (introduced by updating states in a random order) the system can still be thought of a (noisy) vector field. The order of magnitude of samples necessary is linked to the degree to which there is local homogeneity in the gradient. The more homogeneity the fewer samples necessary before mixing. This in turn I believe is determined by how the memories are organized in the weight space. If memories are nicely spaced and separated and paths smoothly tend toward a particular place from a large region the posterior will stabilize quite quickly (empirically as quickly as $2^{10}$ samples for a system with 20 nodes), however if memories are spaced such as to create a more chaotic vector field it may take more the order of examples of >$2^N$\n",
