i hope the bill passes .

petitions 
child pornography 
breast cancer 
mr. réginald bélair ( timmins-james bay , lib. ) : 
mr. speaker , i have two petitions to present today . 
the first one deals with breast cancer . 
canada post corporation 
mr. réginald bélair ( timmins-james bay , lib. ) : 
* * * 
questions on the order paper 
the deputy speaker : 
is it agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
canadian institutes of health research act 
*UNK* are often *UNK* with sadness . 
what a past to celebrate . 
the cihr is a direct response to these *UNK* challenges . 
how will it do that ? 
the structure of the institutes must be simple and *UNK* . 
there is another key element in the institutes ' agenda . 
*UNK* lies the test of real leadership . 
the government shares that belief . 
and this is only the beginning . 
mr. reed elley ( nanaimo-cowichan , canadian alliance ) : 
why is that ? 
it puts the provinces in a tremendous dilemma . 
we know what happens . 
it cannot . 
let me repeat that . 
it represents *UNK* for each person in canada today . 
first , i would like to speak to accessibility . 
second , i would like to speak to *UNK* . 
this goes on all the time across the country . 
the liberal government . 
it has to change . 
there are lots of ways to split up the problem . 
we are always in need of improvement . 
it is a novel idea . 
funding should be upon merit alone . 
as with any organization consistency is appropriate . 
we all recognize that *UNK* will occur . 
i am in favour of the intent of bill c-13 . 
we cannot allow this to continue . 
of course a major part of this problem involves taxes . 
mr. réal ménard ( hochelaga-maisonneuve , bq ) : 
let us begin by the beginning . 
we will have some numbers to provide on this later . 
this is a national average . 
mr. ghislain lebel : 
this is truly shameful . 
mr. réal ménard : 
mr. ghislain lebel : 
at laval university . 
mr. réal ménard : 
at laval university . 
we are facing a situation we have questions about . 
we repeated the request in 1997 . 
there is a paradox in the bill . 
there is another paradox . 
really now , that makes no sense . 
the government has failed in its duty . 
unfortunately , the government turned a deaf ear to them . 
i will now begin reading the letter : 
does the hon. member for chambly remember ? 
mr. yvon charbonneau : 
it comes from the word trouble . 
mr. réal ménard : 
it comes from the word trouble , as in *UNK* . 
the government of quebec is *UNK* . 
i will go back to the letter : 
the letter further states : 
with regard to research , the letter says : 
he was an *UNK* . 
this is typical of canadian history . 
this is quite something . 
we have nothing against voluntary organizations . 
the letter goes on : 
i am referring also to aids . 
i would like to recall five of our amendments . 
( b *UNK* ) 
i will conclude on three points . 
the deputy speaker : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
ms. judy wasylycia-leis ( winnipeg north centre , ndp ) : 
we have tried to seek changes in those areas . 
this bill is about research . 
our objective at committee was straightforward and simple . 
they were hardly considered for a moment by the government . 
does this not sound simple ? 
mr. john solomon : 
a very good *UNK* . 
ms. judy wasylycia-leis : 
the whole issue of commercialization was one of our concerns . 
we wanted to ensure that the board reflected the population . 
did we get gender *UNK* ? 
no , we did not . 
we were *UNK* . 
we were *UNK* . 
we were *UNK* . 
no , it did not . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
i do not know whether the hon. member wants to respond . 
i would like that to end . 
ms. judy wasylycia-leis : 
mr. john solomon ( regina-lumsden-lake centre , ndp ) : 
who basically drove the liberal agenda ? 
ms. judy wasylycia-leis : 
mr. speaker , i thank my colleague for that question . 
mr. john solomon : 
did you say ralph chrétien or ralph klein ? 
ms. judy wasylycia-leis : 
it could be ralph chrétien or jean klein . 
we are talking about two *UNK* in a *UNK* . 
it is a pleasure to take part in this debate today . 
the prime minister has been around for a long time . 
these are very serious concerns in my view . 
that is a very legitimate concern . 
the health care system needs money . 
the liberals seem to run from that . 
mr. andré bachand ( richmond-arthabaska , pc ) : 
first , the provinces were mentioned frequently . 
this has been looked into . 
the answer is yes , it is legal . 
it forgot about that . 
we would like to see the government reconsider it . 
it is a lot of people . 
it would have been nice . 
why not ? 
we find that somewhat unfortunate . 
members are appointed for three years , but during pleasure . 
they will play *UNK* chairs . 
this was seen in government agencies . 
we find it unfortunate . 
this is also a very complex bill . 
reference was made to the role of the private sector . 
who was in office in the *UNK* ? 
i mentioned the private sector ' s role . 
all our questions may not get answered . 
it may also enter into a partnership with governments . 
great . 
perhaps . 
is this desirable ? 
why not ? 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
it is a very important concept . 
a very important principle is being *UNK* in the bill . 
they will not be institutes that have *UNK* and *UNK* . 
a network of some 10 to 15 institutes will be established . 
many other witnesses also said that . 
that should not be taken very lightly . 
this is a very important bill . 
it is very significant . 
we have to do this right , though . 
it is a possibility . 
members should ask themselves why anyone would have concerns . 
what is the motivation ? 
there are some reasons . 
in fact some of those concerns were expressed . 
we have to be honest . 
it is a signal that something needs to be addressed . 
the theme comes up again . 
she said : 
why can they not be consistent ? 
i think that is shameful . 
the finance committee was meeting at the same time . 
here again are politics coming into play . 
i am a *UNK* member of parliament . 
it is on the record . 
i understand that these people will be of the highest integrity . 
they will be beyond *UNK* . 
it is not debatable . 
that is why it will operate at arm ' s length . 
we already have mechanisms in place . 
we need to think about the governance model . 
mr. ghislain lebel ( chambly , bq ) : 
he talked about moving motion no. 56 . 
mr. paul szabo : 
the member was not there . 
another member is responsible for delivering that amendment . 
i found it disgusting . 
mr. bob mills ( red deer , canadian alliance ) : 
i would ask the member to clarify that . 
it is rather interesting and rather amazing to hear the- 
mr. paul szabo : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. bob mills : 
i also want to clarify the position of the canadian alliance . 
canadians are opposed to that . 
it is important that canadians hear that firsthand . 
this bill does that . 
a great many people told our committee what should happen . 
she is *UNK* her *UNK* in *UNK* . 
she will *UNK* this spring . 
he stated : 
fifth , he said that we must be internationally competitive . 
these are the reasons we can support the bill . 
we must also look at other factors . 
that goes right down to the researchers in the *UNK* . 
we talk about accessibility . 
ask about it being comprehensive . 
that is what the canadian alliance wants . 
the final area is public administration . 
we have all kinds of problems there . 
are we getting results from our health care system ? 
that is exactly what canadians do not want to hear . 
it is not sustainable . 
they have not funded the system adequately . 
they have cut *UNK* billion from health care . 
all canadians want it to be fixed . 
mr. rené laurin ( joliette , bq ) : 
if so , how ? 
mr. bob mills : 
we need to improve dramatically . 
the member opposite also talked about that . 
if we look at the facts , they are clear . 
mr. bob mills : 
mr. pierre de savoye ( portneuf , bq ) : 
mr. bob mills : 
mr. speaker , that is a very real concern . 
mr. pierre de savoye : 
mr. bob mills : 
that comes from a lack of long term planning . 
mrs. suzanne tremblay ( rimouski-mitis , bq ) : 
the mission of the institutes includes some interesting and innovative aspects . 
the approach is clearly *UNK* . 
this is still the case today . 
let us make no mistake . 
the speaker : 
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member . 
we will now begin with statements by members . 
statements by members 
mr. steve mahoney ( mississauga west , lib. ) : 
in *UNK* alone , 500 people per day die from aids . 
* * * 
hepatitis c 
mr. reed elley ( nanaimo-cowichan , canadian alliance ) : 
what is the status of the compensation plan ? 
to date , the lawyers have been paid . 
well , the lawyers have been paid . 
what a sad excuse for compassionate health care . 
the government ought to be ashamed of itself . 
* * * 
quebec minister of transport 
mr. raymond lavigne ( verdun-saint-henri , lib. ) : 
he prefers *UNK* instead .

mr. charlie penson ( peace river , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. charlie penson ( peace river , canadian alliance ) :

our priority is to create jobs .

the speaker : 
it is further stated on the same page : 
mr. joe fontana ( london north centre , lib. ) : 
mr. chuck strahl ( fraser valley , canadian alliance ) : 
it does seem odd to me . 
the speaker : 
that will be answered when we are in committee . 
there have been discussions that- 
the speaker : 
order , please . 
we will wait for that . 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
we have done this time and again . 
they *UNK* leak public documents . 
nor did i have any intention of doing anything wrong . 
that is the last thing i would do . 
i respect that , mr. speaker . 
i take that as a serious matter . 
i would suggest very little to none . 
let us look at the issue of time allocation . 
it is approaching 60 times . 
a majority of cases . 
this has become absolutely routine . 
debate ended after a very few hours . 
it is completely unacceptable . 
this has become routine . 
it is shameful . 
what was my great crime ? 
i believe i was doing nothing wrong . 
that is my great crime . 
it just is not . 
mr. speaker , i fully respect your decision . 
it just was not working . 
about 600 people came into the country illegally by boat . 
the committee debated . 
that assurance was given . 
so there we were . 
i listened to them . 
other committee members listened to them . 
they were completely ignored . 
how must they feel ? 
it is sad . 
the committee is functioning poorly now . 
what else could be more important than that ? 
ms. sophia leung ( vancouver kingsway , lib. ) : 
mr. speaker indicated exactly that in his ruling . 
that is disgusting . 
it was without any concern for his duty and his responsibility . 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
mr. speaker , i thank the member for that question . 
the committee had *UNK* gone in camera . 
why did she not do that ? 
unfortunately i was not at that meeting . 
she talked about my not being at some of the meetings . 
i am going to have no part of it . 
i am going to respect the rules of the committee . 
the speaker : 
that is out of order . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. speaker , i have a very simple question . 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
mr. speaker , i thank the member for his question . 
that is improper . 
the rules were not being respected . 
that was my decision at the time . 
i would suggest that it was a good decision . 
we cannot hold a vote when there is no quorum . 
mr. john bryden ( wentworth-burlington , lib. ) : 
would that not have satisfied the member ? 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
how could i have left ? 
mr. steve mahoney ( mississauga west , lib. ) : 
mr. speaker , i heard you say that . 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i do not see a contradiction . 
the speaker : 
mr. steve mahoney : 
an hon. member : 
that is not uncommon . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
no , that is not uncommon . 
he thinks what he did was right . 
there are a couple of basic principles here . 
this member *UNK* all refugees to be illegal . 
why ? 
we have to share the *UNK* and spread the responsibility . 
we do that before we go public with it . 
confidential means it is confidential . 
it is a very difficult concept . 
i respect that . 
can anyone imagine the *UNK* ? 
i would not have had a problem with that . 
the committee could have voted on it . 
he did not do that . 
i will now deal with that issue . 
why would that happen ? 
that is not wrong . 
that is consultation . 
it only makes sense to do that . 
it is incredible . 
it is truly hard to understand . 
i made a mistake ' ' . 
i highly doubt that we will . 
instead he rose to argue his case . 
guess what ? 
he does not care what the speaker said . 
he does not care about the opposition . 
mr. speaker , he just does not care . 
i still do not like the report . 
i still do not like the minister ' ' *UNK* . 
i understand and respect all of that . 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
mr. speaker , this member is truly very *UNK* . 
that was my understanding . 
that i will find out . 
i will look over hansard later . 
we were not . 
i think that would be beneficial . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
i can be as accurate as the member wants . 
let me respond . 
it is a bit *UNK* . 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
that is the issue . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
mr. speaker , really , this is almost silly . 
ms. jean augustine ( etobicoke-lakeshore , lib. ) : 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
that is scary stuff . 
ms. jean augustine : 
mr. steve mahoney : 
the meetings are recorded anyway . 
everything we do and say in committee is recorded . 
it is made available in the record . 
boy , that is pretty scary . 
scary is not the right word . 
as it was , he was no help at all . 
mr. bernard bigras ( rosemont , bq ) : 
why surprised ? 
this document *UNK* what the witnesses had had to say . 
i quote my statement of march 2 : 
why ? 
again , i am quoting the *UNK* . 
this is my interpretation or my version of these events . 
mr. joe jordan : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
perhaps you could provide some clarification . 
this debate is redundant . 
the member might be a little confused . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
the speaker ruled that in fact there was . 
subsequently this debate has to do with that . 
*UNK* we could debate this for two or three weeks . 
mr. rey d. pagtakhan ( winnipeg north-st . 
that is very sad . 
let me state one principle . 
that is my contribution to this debate at this point . 
mr. bernard bigras : 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
i believe that to be true . 
we know that is true . 
i have a direct question for the bloc critic . 
he commented on the need to respect the rules . 
mr. bernard bigras : 
thank you ' ' . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. joe fontana ( london north centre , lib. ) : 
that is the issue . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. bernard bigras : 
was a vote held or not ? 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
the issue before us this afternoon is a very serious one . 
the member for london north centre moved : 
it is a long , drawn out process . 
there is no question or debate on that part . 
it is very interesting . 
i know the speaker made the ruling . 
we need some place of final authority . 
we may not always like it . 
i have experienced those same frustrations . 
i was substituting in committee . 
it was late at night . 
it was probably *UNK* or 11 o ' clock at night . 
you know the rules , mr. speaker . 
he said ``i just did ' ' . 
every organization in this country is based on democracy . 
by then the liberals had *UNK* . 
i related the story . 
that was the end of the matter . 
that is not acceptable . 
hon. jim peterson : 
oh , come on . 
mr. ken epp : 
hon. jim peterson : 
he did not do that . 
he is the best chairman i have ever seen . 
mr. ken epp : 
i was there , the member was not . 
i say this as kindly as i can to liberal members . 
however , i have a very serious question to pose . 
that is the only difference . 
the last budget is a perfect example . 
there are no repercussions any more . 
government members won the election . 
i have had conversations with people . 
there is no respect for it . 
hon. jim peterson : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
mr. ken epp : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. ken epp : 
thank you , mr. speaker . 
i move : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
the amendment is in order . 
debate is on the amendment . 
mr. steve mahoney ( mississauga west , lib. ) : 
how about that ? 
something came before it was ready . 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i can answer that question . 
that is exactly why it was removed . 
i will answer his question . 
do i understand the word premature ? 
yes , i do . 
mr. joe fontana ( london north centre , lib. ) : 
we were discussing options . 
we must respect one another . 
we cannot sit on every committee . 
it was not the case . 
i hope that is the case . 
we are trying to be helpful here . 
we are trying to learn from one another . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. joe fontana : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. joe fontana : 
therefore i am not moving that my motion be removed . 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i have presented the situation as i see it . 
i have also heard the ruling of the speaker . 
i do apologize . 
mr. joe fontana : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
mr. joe jordan ( leeds-grenville , lib. ) : 
is it the hon. member for elk island ? 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
the hon. member for london north centre was on debate . 
mr. joe jordan : 
is this simply an argument of the ends *UNK* the means ? 
mr. joe fontana : 
this is a very important issue . 
the member participated . 
i invited him to attend the meetings . 
he refused to participate any further in the meetings . 
the ends do not justify the means . 
this kind of action is not to be *UNK* at all . 
we are to respect the rules of the house . 
that is what democracy is all about . 
the ends do not justify the means . 
mr. chuck strahl : 
madam speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
that is exactly where we are right now . 
it just says the motion has usually been withdrawn . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
i do not believe that is so . 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
an hon. member : 
no . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mrs. suzanne tremblay : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mr. monte solberg ( medicine hat , canadian alliance ) : 
he has done the right thing . 
i will explain exactly what i mean . 
it was to be discussed publicly . 
what did it do ? 
apparently that is all that is required . 
committees govern themselves ' ' . 
mr. joe fontana : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mr. joe fontana : 
mr. chuck strahl : 
madam speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
it is a point of debate . 
let the debate continue . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mr. monte solberg : 
there is no question about that . 
the whip sits *UNK* 
mr. jay hill : 
the government whip . 
mr. monte solberg : 
that is democracy liberal style . 
this was a canadian heritage committee protecting canadian heritage . 
mrs. suzanne tremblay : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
mr. bob kilger : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
mr. monte solberg : 
people keep interrupting me . 
i think that is wrong . 
i hate to use that term . 
we have rules in place that *UNK* that . 
* * * 
business of the house 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the time is getting very close to a certain *UNK* hour . 
i move : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
private members ' business 
shipbuilding act , 1999 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
mr. antoine dubé : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
ms. alexa mcdonough ( halifax , ndp ) : 
why do i say before it was too late ? 
it would be enormous for the canadian shipbuilding industry . 
some priority . 
it is doable . 
the aim of this bill is reasonable . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. peter stoffer : 
mr. antoine dubé : 
i rise on a point of order , mr. speaker . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
we will do it or we will not . 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
mr. pat o ' brien ( london-fanshawe , lib. ) : 
canadians are very clear . 
i know that we have agreed to a four minute limit . 
mr. charlie penson ( peace river , canadian alliance ) : 
we could do something at home . 
other countries are subsidizing their shipbuilding industries . 
the agriculture and shipbuilding industries are severely *UNK* . 
an hon. member : 
that would only take about 10 years . 
mr. charlie penson : 
mr. yves rocheleau ( trois-rivières , bq ) : 
we just had evidence of that earlier , once more . 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
it *UNK* *UNK* . 
better jobs in the states ? 
go ahead and leave ' ' . 
mr. jean-paul marchand ( québec east , bq ) : 
there is no *UNK* . 
why not institute a similar program here in canada ? 
mr. peter stoffer ( sackville-musquodoboit valley-eastern shore , ndp ) : 
that is old history . 
i have a little more history for the liberals . 
the government continually *UNK* the general public . 
what does the government do ? 
it is absolutely scandalous . 
these people are not asking for handouts . 
other governments support their workers and industry . 
it is an absolute disgrace . 
mr. john herron ( fundy-royal , pc ) : 
mr. antoine dubé ( lévis-et-chutes-de-la-chaudière , bq ) : 
i am truly grateful . 
that goes for liberal members as well . 
they wanted a debate to be held . 
i appeal to the liberal members . 
why ? 
there are barely 3,000 now . 
two great shipyards are facing closure . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
adjournment proceedings 
gasoline pricing 
mr. john solomon ( regina-lumsden-lake centre , ndp ) : 
i will quote from hansard . 
he said : 
it is of course only *UNK* cents in total . 
he said : 
this had nothing to do with my question . 
i wanted to know the government ' s plan . 
he could *UNK* up the competition act . 
he referred to regulations as well . 
they exhausted the research and brought the data forward . 
it is not exclusive .

government orders 
the budget 
financial statement of the minister of finance 
mrs. suzanne tremblay ( rimouski-mitis , bq ) : 
then the minister of finance ' s moment of *UNK* *UNK* . 
year after year , the scenario never changes . 
their expectations are never met . 
but this year things were different . 
but no improvements are planned . 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
mrs. suzanne tremblay : 
this is very interesting . 
there is no employment insurance fund . 
let us be honest . 
the money was spent . 
i think it is outrageous to do this . 
mr. serge cardin ( sherbrooke , bq ) : 
unfortunately , not everyone will be invited at its table . 
this organization told us the following : 
he stated further : 
the association also observed : 
we asked *UNK* you satisfied with the *UNK* ' ' 
what did the bloc quebecois want ? 
nothing very complicated . 
we could have easily put together a budget . 
these requests were ignored . 
*UNK* is not synonymous with tax cuts . 
i will repeat them because this is very important . 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
i wanted to raise that for him . 
maybe he can answer it . 
mr. serge cardin : 
mr. speaker , i thank my colleague for his question . 
ms. jean augustine ( etobicoke-lakeshore , lib. ) : 
i will be splitting my time with the member for simcoe-grey . 
they want us to give them some opportunity for tax relief . 
they want to see some reform to the tax system . 
i was pleased to see that . 
first , the plan will restore full indexation . 
budget 2000 addresses these concerns . 
i stand in support of budget 2000 . 
mr. dick proctor ( palliser , ndp ) : 
ms. jean augustine : 
mr. paul bonwick ( simcoe-grey , lib. ) : 
ms. jean augustine : 
mr. paul bonwick ( simcoe-grey , lib. ) : 
the first is to listen . 
my hat goes off to him . 
again , my hat goes off to him for that . 
we talk about how the process works . 
they talked about a *UNK* effort . 
that is what they want . 
that is a message that i delivered loud and clear . 
i view the role of the party as being the same . 
my analogy would simply be this . 
i speak most specifically to incompetence . 
would that provide some incredible level of comfort ? 
would that make it better ? 
has the platform changed ? 
no. has the party changed ? 
my pledge to the future is simply this . 
that is what we are here to do . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. dick proctor ( palliser , ndp ) : 
mr. speaker , i congratulate the member for simcoe-grey . 
mr. paul bonwick : 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
i believe everything that has happened has been despite the government . 
i sometimes just shake my head in *UNK* . 
what a rich country we have . 
we are rich in resources , in mines and in *UNK* . 
we have much potential . 
what do we see ? 
this is a political budget . 
i received two answers . 
there is not . 
i think it is good to have long term planning . 
there is no doubt about it . 
let us look at the tax cuts outlined in the budget . 
the government is claiming *UNK* billion in tax cuts . 
let us look at what it really is . 
it does not reduce the tax bill . 
they are *UNK* together income and expenditures . 
let us look at the next one . 
that is absurd . 
the *UNK* billion is an absolute minimum . 
the government has no access to these revenues . 
they are clearly a program . 
mr. ken epp : 
the member is asking the wrong person this question . 
the field of mathematics happens to be my profession . 
i have done these *UNK* . 
mr. paul bonwick ( simcoe-grey , lib. ) : 
let us think about what he was saying . 
members of that party do not want to support that . 
it is absolutely ridiculous . 
the deficit is now gone . 
mr. ken epp : 
i gave it credit . 
that is not so . 
that is what would happen . 
they are taxing them to death . 
they are killing them . 
ms. val meredith ( south surrey-white rock-langley , canadian alliance ) : 
they are claiming that they are cutting taxes by *UNK* billion . 
that is an illusion . 
government members should be *UNK* and honest and say so . 
it is the number one concern . 
and what does the government do ? 
the transportation infrastructure in this country is falling apart . 
mr. mac harb ( ottawa centre , lib. ) : 
does she support the five principles of the health care system ? 
ms. val meredith : 
it is *UNK* itself if it thinks that . 
it has been proven that it does not work . 
the one it is supporting does not work . 
they participate every year . 
that is what happens . 
we are participating in a process which is extremely important . 
next week it starts all over again . 
we will go once more back into the same process . 
we began a discussion . 
we did a little work on it . 
during that year we went to work on it . 
that is what this process is . 
that is what the budget is all about . 
there is no secrecy in it . 
this is why the budget has come through with such *UNK* . 
people see their concerns reflected in it . 
there will always be demands for changes and improvements . 
we will continue to go back into the cycle . 
we will continue to invite canadians into the process .

the budget 
financial statement of minister of finance 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
we all know the history . 
has he ever voted against the current king ' s *UNK* ? 
i say that *UNK* . 
he was *UNK* by the government for doing exactly that . 
did he vote in favour of it ? 
mr. reg alcock : 
the *UNK* were *UNK* on *UNK* in my riding . 
i supported the display wholeheartedly . 
that is how the government runs . 
that is how human society runs . 
it is a *UNK* , *UNK* symbol . 
the reality is life . 
the processes are sometimes called parties . 
mr. rick casson ( lethbridge , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. reg alcock : 
let us look at unemployment . 
the debt is coming down . 
employment is up . 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
mr. reg alcock : 
mr. scott brison : 
mr. reg alcock : 
madam speaker , it is very simple . 
they *UNK* the *UNK* . 
mr. rick casson ( lethbridge , canadian alliance ) : 
it will not add up to very much . 
the number one issue that keeps coming up is health care . 
we have not seen it yet . 
it is a concern to everyone . 
we cannot have that . 
we are hurting . 
grants were given when there were no applications . 
she *UNK* their names into this debate . 
they are not the problem . 
that should have been addressed in the budget . 
it has been run down . 
we have to do something about that . 
that was done . 
the whole air transportation industry is in *UNK* . 
we could go on and on . 
the system has failed . 
finally it has been done . 
that is not a tax cut . 
it does not add up . 
i will end my comments with that . 
mr. rick casson : 
that is substantial tax relief . 
that is a *UNK* of money . 
in fact i have not had one person tell me that . 
let us look at some of the numbers . 
that ought to feel good . 
that is a *UNK* of cash . 
off the top we have to take *UNK* billion . 
``we are giving canadians an amazing deal . 
the government is not really taking this money off taxes . 
i suppose that could be called a tax break . 
i taught english , not math . 
let us do the *UNK* equation . 
mr. lou sekora : 
that is who they like . 
mr. roy cullen : 
exactly , those are their supporters . 
miss deborah grey : 
madam speaker , boy , there is a *UNK* . 
that group ran exactly the same numbers for him . 
i put my faith in solution 17 .

mr. gordon earle ( halifax west , ndp ) :

the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
the hon. member ' s time has expired .

mr. bob kilger ( stormont-dundas-charlottenburgh , lib. ) : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i move : 
the deputy speaker : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the deputy speaker : 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
that is the right way to go . 
maybe the member for saskatoon-humboldt will do the same thing . 
i look forward to those speeches . 
indeed we are living in a global society . 
one thing which is obvious is that commerce has become *UNK* . 
big corporations and companies have *UNK* . 
that is something which is very important . 
that brings me to the whole issue of the tobin tax . 
these are the issues young people are concerned with . 
mr. rob anders ( calgary west , canadian alliance ) : 
he said he wanted to see an elected senate too . 
he even said it in calgary . 
hon. lorne nystrom : 
it does this without being accountable to anyone . 
i agree with the member on that . 
that debate should continue . 
it is a debate well worth pursuing . 
the member asked me about *UNK* brown . 
why would he not ? 
they each have 24 senators . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
mr. jim pankiw : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
the hon. member is quite correct . 
the party is known as the canadian alliance . 
mr. lynn myers : 
we will see where that goes . 
mr. philip mayfield : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i would expect that kind of respect . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. howard hilstrom : 
the deputy speaker : 
it is not for the speaker to ask questions . 
i think the point has been made . 
mr. lynn myers : 
mr. howard hilstrom : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
i think the hon. member has done that very nicely . 
mr. lynn myers : 
mr. speaker , they are certainly *UNK* . 
he was part of that . 
he was on the *UNK* of mexico . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the deputy speaker : 
order , please . 
the comments seem to be going around a bit . 
mr. lynn myers : 
he talked about the senate . 
did the hon. member agree with that member ? 
why is it that those people opposite would be silent on *UNK* 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the deputy speaker : 
i think the question has gone on long enough . 
hon. lorne nystrom : 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the deputy speaker : 
order , please . 
the hon. member from regina-qu ' appelle has the floor . 
hon. lorne nystrom : 
he should ask his constituents how they feel about it . 
it is not a democratic body . 
i would be surprised if anybody said yes . 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
i also was a *UNK* for cbc and *UNK* . 
mr. bob speller : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
the hon. member is quite correct . 
mr. scott brison : 
these issues have partially been addressed by the government . 
it will *UNK* and be a very *UNK* initiative . 
these *UNK* are reflected in the canadian dollar . 
this is a challenge . 
this is both positive and negative . 
let us talk about the brave new world that is available . 
it is a very exciting time . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
mr. clark is the leader of the conservative party . 
why was he not standing up for canada ? 
he was nowhere to be seen . 
he should be ashamed . 
mr. scott brison : 
they flip-flop every day . 
they had that opportunity . 
that is what this government has done for this country . 
mr. scott brison : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
it is important to note that- 
mr. philip mayfield : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
the hon. member for cariboo-chilcotin has called quorum . 
and the count having been taken : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
call in the members . 
and the bells having rung : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
we have quorum . 
mr. lynn myers : 
it will also apply to crown corporations . 
that is very important . 
small and medium businesses are the *UNK* for canada . 
it is appropriate that we move in that sense accordingly . 
this makes for better lives for them and their families . 
canada is above that . 
i reject that . 
after all that is what canadians want . 
we can talk a great deal in this house of commons . 
witness health care for example . 
imagine what mr. harris is doing . 
it really should not happen . 
why do they do that ? 
the 10 principles are noted as follows . 
number one relates to accountability . 
accountability is very important . 
number three in the code is consent . 
they want it and they need it . 
number four is the limited collection code principle . 
again , i think that too is important . 
number six is *UNK* . 
number seven is the principle of safeguards . 
again , this is part of transparency . 
number nine is individual access . 
there is a five year review built into the bill . 
mr. andré harvey ( chicoutimi , pc ) : 
he could be in for some big surprises . 
mr. lynn myers : 
mr. andré harvey : 
terrible . 
it is the beginning of the end . 
mr. lynn myers : 
that is what mr. mulroney did . 
they were reduced to two seats . 
why ? 
it is not consistent with the party of *UNK* . 
mr. rahim jaffer ( edmonton-strathcona , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. lynn myers : 
an hon. member : 
he did not talk about quebec . 
an hon. member : 
he said that the bloc indicated that it had concerns . 
we have made that very clear . 
let us think about that for a minute . 
mr. roy bailey : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
i suspect that could have a little debate in it . 
we will go to the next question . 
mr. benoît sauvageau ( repentigny , bq ) : 
my reform colleague talked about alberta . 
my reform colleague ' s question concerned alberta . 
it concerns provincial jurisdiction . 
this is not a group of separatists . 
it is opposed to bill c-6 . 
there is also the *UNK* des *UNK* . 
it is opposed to bill c-6 . 
mr. lynn myers : 
mr. benoît sauvageau : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
mr. lynn myers : 
mr. speaker , the hon. member opposite *UNK* the gun . 
the member claims to be protecting the interests of his constituents . 
he claims to be protecting quebecers *UNK* they live . 
mr. rahim jaffer ( edmonton-strathcona , canadian alliance ) : 
it just does not care about dealing with the provincial concerns . 
i talked briefly about this point earlier . 
the government would be better off to allow that . 
at least it moves in the right direction . 
we need some form of commitment from the government . 
mr. philip mayfield ( cariboo-chilcotin , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. rahim jaffer : 
it was to no *UNK* . 
mr. pat martin ( winnipeg centre , ndp ) : 
mr. rahim jaffer : 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. rahim jaffer : 
my hon. colleague has asked a perfectly legitimate question . 
this is a *UNK* important issue . 
it was an interesting *UNK* . 
we see that . 
we can send out 10 million cheques with *UNK* . 
we can do very large *UNK* based operations . 
but the outside world has changed enormously . 
i like his framework for that . 
we heard a lot about quality in the *UNK* . 
this takes us into the decade of *UNK* . 
for the first time they could actually *UNK* their organization . 
what happened in government ? 
what is the nature of the quality movement in government ? 
*UNK* in government *UNK* to become privatization . 
it was the *UNK* issue coming at us . 
a lot of people could become educated . 
it is interesting . 
think about that for a second . 
there is a modern example of that . 
they cannot be *UNK* in the same way . 
the same thing is happening in china . 
in many ways we are not different . 
i have no fear of the *UNK* . 
people accept that we can do that . 
it was a concern about rights . 
it was a human rights argument . 
it was : ``what are my rights relative to the government ? 
this is an important piece of legislation . 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
the hon. member has studied this a great deal . 
mr. reg alcock : 
i am tired of this ' ' . 
again , our understanding is *UNK* . 
the hon. member raises a really good question . 
it is not a criticism . 
i know mine are . 
mr. philip mayfield ( cariboo-chilcotin , canadian alliance ) : 
the technology grows in both directions . 
mr. reg alcock : 
does the legislation solve all those problems ? 
no , it does not . 
the health area is an interesting one . 
are we going to say no ? 
largely this is in the commercial system . 
it has the *UNK* right . 
we can do some things . 
it is very difficult . 
mr. yves rocheleau ( trois-rivières , bq ) : 
it is the civil code . 
the speaker : 
i apologize for interrupting the hon. member .

we hardly have a cent ourselves .

what workers feel is not *UNK*

oral question period 
human resources development 
why are ethics not of concern to this government ? 
mr. speaker , this is a little story tale here . 
we continue to build a strong public service . 
which way would they have it ? 
things are much different there now . 
what is the important modern method ? 
is it incompetence ? 
is it patronage ? 
is it waste ? 
or , is it this *UNK* that this government- 
the speaker : 
the hon. minister of human resources development . 
let us go through this one more time . 
would the opposition have us do it any other way ? 
mrs. diane ablonczy ( calgary-nose hill , canadian alliance ) : 
mrs. diane ablonczy ( calgary-nose hill , canadian alliance ) :

the hon. leader of the bloc quebecois . 
mr. gilles duceppe ( laurier-sainte-marie , bq ) : 
has the minister called for a recovery plan ? 
mr. gilles duceppe ( laurier-sainte-marie , bq ) : 
there were 81 jobs and now there are 78 . 
the minister must stop *UNK* the issue . 
the loan was to *UNK* . 
*UNK* and gauthier were also *UNK* in the bankruptcy . 
it would be pretty hard to find a *UNK* *UNK* .

mr. deepak obhrai ( calgary east , canadian alliance ) : 
the export development corporation .

the *UNK* is an arm ' s length corporation . 
mr. deepak obhrai ( calgary east , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. speaker , arm ' s length , my foot .

mr. bob mills ( red deer , canadian alliance ) : 
we have a mismanaged hrdc department . 
we have a health care system in *UNK* . 
what does the government do ? 
it places a gun to the heads of the provinces .

they want quality health care for canadians . 
mr. greg thompson ( new brunswick southwest , pc ) :

mr. chuck strahl ( fraser valley , canadian alliance ) : 
government orders 
personal information protection and electronic documents act 
mr. yves rocheleau ( trois-rivières , bq ) : 
it may have reasons to do so . 
but the federal government *UNK* ahead . 
it *UNK* us . 
*UNK* the house of commons . 
the federal government is using its spending power to *UNK* . 
we must remember that . 
* * * 
ways and means 
notice of motion 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
* * * 
personal information protection and electronic documents act 
mr. paul crête ( kamouraska-rivière-du-loup-témiscouata-les basques , bq ) : 
mr. yves rocheleau : 
it might perhaps be time to speak of distinct society . 
why does it not ? 
that is what all quebecers wonder . 
if i were a canadian , i would be a *UNK* . 
an hon. member : 
you are one . 
mr. yves rocheleau : 
i am here by accident . 
that is logical . 
mr. michel bellehumeur ( berthier-montcalm , bq ) : 
they could have *UNK* the house up . 
this is what he said : 
i think that this is fairly clear . 
he went on to say : 
it said : *UNK* . 
it is to be expected that many jurisdictional *UNK* will surface . 
in this case , it is rather striking . 
let us be clear . 
the federal act *UNK* into areas under quebec ' s jurisdiction . 
let us take a concrete example . 
will it be the federal act or the provincial act ? 
will both acts apply ? 
i will give an example with regard to individual consent . 
the wording is quite different . 
it is a lengthy bill . 
but how will the courts interpret it ? 
i think it is not going to be clear . 
what is added on ? 
there are several amendments proposed by the senate . 
this too we have said on numerous occasions . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
order , please . 
the hon. member for berthier-montcalm is correct . 
there is a 20 minute *UNK* . 
the bloc then ended up with two *UNK* . 
mr. michel bellehumeur : 
thank you for the *UNK* , mr. speaker . 
i shall try to start where i left off . 
they have said nothing about them . 
i will quote the second paragraph of this letter : 
this was on october 19 , 1999 . 
that was his acknowledgement of *UNK* . 
we have a problem . 
that is where we stand now . 
such is the flexibility of the act . 
this is what this government calls flexibility . 
this is not true either . 
flexibility always works to the advantage of the federal government . 
but they let the opportunity pass . 
what is the point ? 
an hon. member : 
you will need a lot of votes . 
mr. michel bellehumeur : 
do not do that ' ' . 
we also heard the conseil du *UNK* . 
but the government did as it pleased anyway . 
mr. stéphan tremblay ( lac-saint-jean , bq ) : 
mr. michel bellehumeur : 
i see the minister for international trade laughing . 
there is a very broad consensus on that bill . 
but it carries on *UNK* . 
mr. john bryden ( wentworth-burlington , lib. ) : 
i congratulate them on that . 
you can do whatever kind of net *UNK* you like . 
it is a computer search program . 
i have a classic example of what happens . 
these were reflected in the list of these so-called *UNK* . 
there are other things . 
i have studied it actually at some length . 
it is very difficult to control these things . 
it *UNK* the desire for openness . 
you cannot find out the details of their budget . 
you cannot find out what the salaries are . 
you cannot find out that kind of thing . 
these amendments *UNK* to defining personal information . 
i will do my very best . 
i am sorry , mr. speaker , forgive me . 
i am going to get myself into terrible trouble . 
i will get control of the debate again . 
most people are not *UNK* by that . 
it is no secret . 
i will switch back to my suggestion about the internet . 
mr. roy bailey : 
canadian alliance . 
mr. john bryden : 
there are quite a few members and i am very pleased . 
it can be in the united states or anywhere else . 
it does not go far enough . 
that amendment was actually to the definition of commercial activity . 
that is a very dangerous thing . 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
i have been a consensus commissioner . 
does the member see what i am getting at ? 
we will never know . 
i would like the hon. member to comment on that . 
mr. john bryden : 
that act provides for absolute confidentiality . 
*UNK* statistics canada data are absolutely protected . 
i think we have to take it at face value . 
i know the minister is listening . 
mr. howard hilstrom ( selkirk-interlake , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. wayne easter : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
where is this member coming from ? 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. howard hilstrom : 
mr. john bryden : 
so it has to ask close , *UNK* questions . 
the member is quite right . 
we are entitled to know how that money is being spent . 
nevertheless , it is going in the right direction . 
mr. paul crête ( kamouraska-rivière-du-loup-témiscouata-les basques , bq ) : 
that legislation is used as a model throughout the world . 
why such duplication ? 
it would be a terrible legal mess . 
it got the picture right away . 
this was all covered in the quebec act . 
it applies to the health sector . 
it is very clear on the matter of consent . 
how will consumers figure it out ? 
we are faced with the evidence . 
the government made a decision . 
this would cost a considerable amount .

mr. speaker ,

personal information protection and electronic documents act 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. rené laurin ( joliette , bq ) : 
but things did not turn out that way . 
mr. paul crête : 
those were his words . 
we also heard the privacy commissioner . 
this situation has to be looked at in the broader context . 
we have a perfect example of that attitude in this case . 
it has been *UNK* , revised and it works . 
mr. stéphan tremblay ( lac-saint-jean , bq ) : 
mr. paul crête : 
the liberal majority seems intent on imposing it on us . 
we do not know what kind of situation will occur . 
mr. odina desrochers ( lotbinière , bq ) : 
the present prime minister was one of his *UNK* *UNK* . 
i will give a few examples . 
bill c-6 is a fundamental piece of legislation . 
today we have *UNK* radio . 
then there is the whole issue of internet . 
they use the internet . 
what is this government looking for ? 
it is trying to prevent people from *UNK* their views .

ms. jocelyne girard-bujold ( jonquière , bq ) : 
an *UNK* *UNK* only *UNK* gross . 
i would like to know . 
democratic this government is not . 
this is perfectly normal . 
they want action . 
mr. rick limoges ( windsor-st . 
these are the principles that have *UNK* our actions . 
hon. lorne nystrom : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. marceau ) : 
clair is referring to his notes in a proper manner . 
mr. rick limoges : 
mr. derrek konrad : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. marceau ) : 
i think the hon. member for windsor-st . 
clair was making an analogy . 
the hon. member for windsor-st . 
clair . 
he has 45 seconds to finish his speech . 
mr. rick limoges : 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
that is the only change . 
the *UNK* could also deduct the cost of the insurance . 
that is the purpose of the bill . 
i would suggest that they were excuses . 
reform mps fully supported the bill . 
then we come to the government side , the liberals . 
i agree with that . 
that statement is correct . 
that was a very odd statement . 
that is true . 
taxpayers are trusted to do that . 
mr. roy cullen : 
it never raised them once . 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
in this case , that is exactly what would be done . 
this is long overdue . 
the *UNK* are *UNK* in this way . 
mr. howard hilstrom : 
who gave us the *UNK* system ? 
hon. lorne nystrom : 
i assume the progressive conservative party will also be supporting this . 
let us hear from the progressive conservative party . 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
mechanics are no exception . 
mechanics are no exception . 
they have *UNK* not only opposition members but *UNK* government members . 
it *UNK* along in *UNK* . 
mr. odina desrochers ( lotbinière , bq ) : 
in this case , it is mechanics . 
that was what the minister of finance was *UNK* at . 
this bill *UNK* principles in which i believe strongly . 
as far as i am concerned , this is social injustice . 
now , moving on to another of the objectives i support . 
unfortunately , people are constantly leaving the regions . 
why ? 
what does this situation lead to ? 
tomorrow it will be the *UNK* . 
the deputy speaker : 
adjournment proceedings 
justice 
mr. roger gallaway ( sarnia-lambton , lib. ) : 
i am looking for one case . 
they can buy real *UNK* and all sorts of things . 
three years later what do we see ? 
i have to ask how this can be . 
how can this possibly be ? 
i have one final point . 
that is exactly what is happening in this *UNK* . 
it needs to be said that this is not new policy .

the house met at 10 a.m . 
prayers 
government orders 
canada transportation act 
that was false . 
that was false . 
that is the legislative step . 
that is a monopoly . 
we will not tolerate price *UNK* . 
that is not true . 
there is a provision for complaints to be heard . 
we are making it 120 days . 
that will be *UNK* enforced . 
our experience has been that communities always maintain their service . 
the consumer has to be protected . 
we have to make sure there is some oversight . 
we are doing this in a number of ways . 
there is no discrimination . 
they get the full benefit . 
these are very important measures . 
quite frankly i wonder why we have not done this before . 
they say that would be great for canadian consumers . 
we have to give air canada the ability to compete . 
we are not going to allow that . 
what are they saying about canadian entrepreneurs ? 
i assume that air canada will come forward with *UNK* . 
i think it was an accomplishment for the government . 
ms. val meredith ( south surrey-white rock-langley , canadian alliance ) : 
that is important . 
there are problems with this bill . 
that is something which the government must ensure does not happen . 
it will create an equal response from the airline . 
airlines are extremely expensive . 
i do not think that should be allowed . 
i think that should be addressed . 
it is irrelevant . 
i would suggest that needs to be addressed . 
flights are being significantly *UNK* . 
that is not acceptable and has to stop . 
*UNK* are being changed with *UNK* not being informed .

mr. reg alcock : 
the speaker : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
canada transportation act 
mr. rené laurin ( joliette , bq ) : 
it was high time and we were very pleased at that . 
why will we support this ? 
a careful eye must therefore be kept on the situation . 
i will add one thing , however . 
rhetoric seems to be enough for this government . 
but it is not for the bloc quebecois . 
*UNK* does not kill . 
that *UNK* our basic positions . 
we are sovereignists and we are proposing partnership with canada . 
this government ' s policy goes in the opposite way . 
let us talk also about the future of regional *UNK* . 
the bloc quebecois is consistent in its positions . 
yet , it was sold for *UNK* billion . 
these services are now provided by nav canada . 
i quote : 
here is another quote from nav canada found on internet : 
what are these priorities ? 
are they the right priorities ? 
what are the possible solutions ? 
we are of course talking about regional transportation . 
let us take an example . 
this sort of *UNK* is not desirable . 
ms. bev desjarlais ( churchill , ndp ) : 
so where is the competition ? 
the new democratic party is not against markets . 
that is not the case . 
this is the reality . 
it gets worse . 
we have to *UNK* between healthy competition and destructive competition . 
need i say more ? 
sometimes something is so ridiculous that it seems funny . 
this was one of those times . 
i commend the government for this part of the legislation . 
operating an airline in our country is a privilege . 
this is another example of putting blind faith in a market . 
these measures are not even that strong . 
this is not going to work . 
the *UNK* is already mandated to control *UNK* . 
an hon. member : 
there are no reform members . 
ms. bev desjarlais : 
there is the issue of increased foreign ownership . 
is that the answer to everything ? 
did that save it ? 
i do not see it here . 
has increased foreign ownership helped western farmers ? 
ms. bev desjarlais : 
we have a very strong international air service . 
those things could have happened . 
then we would have competition . 
we know that wages have not gone up . 
mr. bill casey ( cumberland-colchester , pc ) : 
i am going to focus on the impact on consumers . 
i believe that the appointment of an ombudsman is important . 
i strongly support the proposal to have an ombudsman . 
thus , the committee *UNK* *UNK* 
really , it is an exciting industry . 
that is only part of the problem . 
that should be addressed and it should be changed . 
there are inconsistent *UNK* as to why planes are delayed . 
in one case i was given three different *UNK* . 
i believe that consumer is entitled to an explanation . 
another thing happened to me this week . 
that was all right . 
the system and the service just was not good enough . 
i do not think he would . 
i do not think so . 
my approach is not *UNK* on this issue . 
my goal is not to be *UNK* with the airlines . 
i am confident that i can to that . 
that was because they have *UNK* service . 
my goal is to help them maintain their reputation . 
for the long term the ombudsman must be there . 
i encourage people to communicate with us . 
check our *UNK* at *UNK* . 
we met some incredible people in the industry . 
we were all impressed with the industry officials . 
mr. bill casey : 
the airlines should know it . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
is the house ready for the question ? 
some hon. members : 
question . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
the question is on the motion . 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
an hon. member : 
on division . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
private members ' business 
canada post corporation act 
mr. joe jordan ( leeds-grenville , lib. ) : 
i personally will support this legislation . 
mr. bill gilmour ( nanaimo-alberni , canadian alliance ) : 
in other words , they cannot form a union . 
these problems need to be addressed . 
this is the crux of the matter . 
we think that is wrong . 
we feel that there are other options available . 
everyone needs to know what the conditions are . 
mr. dick proctor ( palliser , ndp ) : 
she is a wonderful individual . 
most rural route mail couriers barely earn minimum wage . 
some *UNK* have more than one route . 
they have to train and pay their own *UNK* . 
they are provided with basic supplies . 
this is a denial of basic rights . 
mr. gerald keddy ( south shore , pc ) : 
there are a number of issues . 
they are all *UNK* together in one bill . 
the member speaks specifically to section 13 ( 5 ) . 
what can we do ? 
we have made a difference . 
these include the following . 
rural routes will be *UNK* on an individual contractor basis . 
many other changes have been instituted as well . 
we obviously have to make a change . 
we can continue to provide service in rural canada . 
i depend upon a rural mail *UNK* . 
he is a very good friend of mine . 
we would then take another look at it . 
an hon. member : 
it is the new canadian alliance . 
hon. lorne nystrom : 
madam speaker , maybe there is a new alliance . 
it is very important that this link be there . 
there is no protection . 
there is no association . 
there is no *UNK* . 
once again i congratulate the member for winnipeg centre . 
ms. bev desjarlais ( churchill , ndp ) : 
let us not be afraid to let canadians make the decision . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mr. pat martin ( winnipeg centre , ndp ) : 
in mexico rural route mail couriers are allowed to bargain collectively . 
rural route mail couriers are very well organized . 
they are very committed and very dedicated . 
they may form their own independent association . 
it is a given . 
we are talking about them . 
i have been serving rural canada customers for 17 years . 
i have hurt my back at work . 
i don ' t have any sick benefits . 
we can see the difficulty . 
i know rural jobs are hard to come by . 
another women said : 
i can ' t afford to take one .

house of commons 
monday , april 3 , 2000 
the house met at 11 a.m . 
prayers 
private members ' business 
mr. peter stoffer : 
madam speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
* * * 
natural gas 
at that time the motion was called motion no. 292 . 
canada is blessed with tremendous natural gas resources . 
gas could have been distributed in nova scotia as well . 
those lines are all headed south . 
why are health care costs continuing to *UNK* ? 
environmental factors in human health are no longer denied . 
far from it . 
let us consider this example . 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
i appreciate what his colleague had to say as well . 
there is one advantage of being a little older . 
there were *UNK* of steel pipe , grey in *UNK* . 
there was no further development . 
i am not sure if that is possible . 
i am not saying it would be impossible . 
it sounds like it is easy to accomplish . 
we would have to make sure there was some way . 
it would be extremely expensive . 
it had all these things going on without environment approval . 
we are not ready for it . 
i do not think the *UNK* has been done . 
mr. ghislain lebel ( chambly , bq ) : 
canada ' s natural gas reserves are immense . 
they are beyond anyone ' s imagination . 
we are talking 500 to 600 *UNK* *UNK* *UNK* . 
but it does exist . 
this is an important factor in the issue . 
there is nothing wrong with that . 
that is not what the government does . 
they do not enter into discussion ' ' . 
ships will continue to travel it . 
the *UNK* *UNK* will continue to blow in the same direction . 
quebec is well *UNK* . 
there will be international agreements . 
we in the bloc quebecois are in agreement . 
the ndp ' s suggestion is an excellent one . 
i have seen this . 
the government has done nothing about this . 
mr. bill casey ( cumberland-colchester , pc ) : 
governments seem to have their hands tied . 
we certainly support the motion . 
it impacts on employment . 
it means zero growth . 
it is more than just the economic issue here . 
it is the standard of living . 
it is the way of life . 
it is the culture . 
therefore we support this motion . 
it only makes sense . 
there is another benefit of this proposal . 
it could use natural gas to *UNK* those energy costs . 
those coal mines are now filled with hot water . 
it would help economic development . 
it would definitely bring jobs to that area . 
we have just gone through this urgent situation this morning . 
that instability is extremely difficult for people to handle . 
they cannot compete . 
those residents are going to have to pay higher energy costs . 
we will all be winners if this bill goes through . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
we really should be and we must be . 
the reason is quite simple . 
we have growing markets and a favourable public policy framework . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
government orders 
speaker ' s ruling 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) :

motion no. 4 
mr. chuck strahl ( fraser valley , canadian alliance ) : 
marleau and *UNK* at page *UNK* reads : 
mr. svend j. robinson ( burnaby-douglas , ndp ) : 
the standing orders are very clear . 
mr. chuck strahl : 
obviously there is a *UNK* when we do that . 
mr. tom wappel ( scarborough southwest , lib. ) : 
his motion was dealt with by the committee . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) :

mr. svend j. robinson ( burnaby-douglas , ndp ) : 
i see the member for scarborough centre here . 
he has been very clear . 
he does not believe in equality . 
let us be clear what this is about . 
that was the definition of marriage then . 
marriage was for life . 
i do not think so . 
the *UNK* is moving ahead . 
mr. tom wappel ( scarborough southwest , lib. ) : 
what has the government done in response to that ? 
what has the government done ? 
it has not done anything radical . 
it has not done anything unusual . 
my amendment is a very specific amendment . 
i guess we are talking *UNK* . 
this is the way i view it . 
bill c-23 is an *UNK* bill . 
they command that those other acts be amended . 
it will not be *UNK* in the revised statutes of canada . 
the shame is *UNK* . 
this is not an accident . 
it is by design . 
then they need not debate the issues . 
it has been since the time of *UNK* . 
enough of this name calling . 
let us just deal with the issues . 
that definition is the common law of canada . 
it is the position of the government of canada . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. speaker , what does bill c-23 do ? 
i do not know what people in same sex relationships do . 
perhaps they walk out the door when it is over . 
it is not clear from the bill . 
public pressure against the bill has been enormous . 
do not be *UNK* . 
it will not appear in canadian law . 
some previous case law was also considered . 
it does not really achieve anything . 
i will quote again from this leading legal expert : 
a conjugal relationship implies that . 
that is what the dictionary says . 
mr. réal ménard ( hochelaga-maisonneuve , bq ) : 
that is a lot . 
what does this bill propose ? 
it affects employment insurance . 
the bill deals , of course , with income tax . 
why ? 
why is that ? 
notwithstanding , i will address some of the concerns expressed . 
it has been successfully defended and upheld by the courts . 
this bill is not about marriage . 
this amendment reflects this fact . 
these *UNK* will be maintained in federal law . 
bill c-23 does this . 
mr. grant mcnally ( dewdney-alouette , canadian alliance ) : 
some might wonder what i mean by this term . 
let us take a look at this philosophical *UNK* . 
truth is relative . 
that is all fine and good . 
``oh , really ' ' , would say the *UNK* . 
the house of cards argument falls in on itself . 
i would not include myself in that category . 
it is something i call the language game . 
who would be against equality ? 
who would possibly want to be perceived as anything but tolerant ? 
who could disagree with either of these statements ? 
let us look at the term tolerance . 
what does the government call tolerance ? 
what does the justice minister call tolerance ? 
what does she mean by the words tolerance and equality ? 
that is the first part of tolerance . 
mr. paul forseth ( new westminster-coquitlam-burnaby , canadian alliance ) : 
the *UNK* and *UNK* political groups are happy . 
in that section it says : 
they said at the justice committee : 
we need to build community consensus on these things . 
no one should be discriminated against in basic human rights . 
common law status will now have wide interpretation . 
the change to one year will have *UNK* social effects . 
mr. andré bachand ( richmond-arthabaska , pc ) : 
bill c-23 hits us hard in the *UNK* . 
this bill is not easy . 
people ask us ``why talk about *UNK* and *UNK* ' ' 
who does not know people who are *UNK* or *UNK* ? 
there is the marriage issue ' ' . 
why do i say that ? 
the concept of distinct society was included in a preamble . 
it was a rule of interpretation . 
personally , i am very , very pleased with that rule . 
personally , i will support the bill . 
the answer is no . 
this makes bill c-23 an absolutely incredible document . 
i had discussions with people in my riding . 
some people ask many more questions than others . 
you are living in sin . 
finally , things have evolved . 
do we provide the same benefits ? 
i was asked how i saw it ? 
that was what i wanted . 
i do not feel excluded from society in any way . 
i am a *UNK* catholic and i do not feel excluded . 
that does not change . 
this is a reality . 
i do not have the answer . 
has it been seen ? 
i have seen not such thing . 
have hon. members seen signs *UNK* ``we are *UNK* . 
we are against *UNK* ' ' ? 
i have not . 
mr. deepak obhrai : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mr. andré bachand : 
mr. garry breitkreuz ( yorkton-melville , canadian alliance ) : 
that will be the whole point of my speech . 
i ask him too to look at reality . 
who *UNK* ? 
it is the children . 
that is my theme today . 
let me explain . 
this is not just an issue of personal conscience . 
it is the children who are hurt . 
those are the consequences . 
it is not a sexual relationship . 
we have done some *UNK* research on this . 
why ? 
it amends 68 other pieces of legislation . 
that is the great flaw with this legislation . 
let us never forget that . 
it only called me names . 
many were shocked . 
here is another aside . 
i would now like to go through that . 
how do these family *UNK* affect children ? 
*UNK* are higher . 
illegal drug use is greater . 
four out of every five *UNK* come from broken homes . 
an hon. member : 
relevance ? 
mr. svend j. robinson : 
it is a disgrace . 
mr. garry breitkreuz : 
it simply *UNK* *UNK* 
mr. svend j. robinson : 
is this the new canadian alliance ? 
the speaker : 
order , please .

i cannot finish the rest .

questions on the order paper 
the deputy speaker : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
mr. chuck strahl ( fraser valley , canadian alliance ) : 
it is opening up a *UNK* ' s box . 
it is not *UNK* benefits . 
it may be trying to modernize language . 
that debate has never taken place . 
times change and the world situation changes . 
none of those discussions took place . 
none of those consultations took place . 
that is a gross failing of the bill . 
i can see it coming . 
where are we going ? 
we are going to the courts . 
this legislation will end up in the courts . 
it will cost a *UNK* of money . 
i do not blame the courts for this . 
he is an acknowledged expert in this field . 
he said : 
approval of our amendments will strengthen the bill . 
ms. libby davies ( vancouver east , ndp ) : 
i am proud to be from the riding of vancouver east . 
that is what we should keep in mind here . 
the deputy speaker : 
it is the canadian alliance . 
ms. libby davies : 
an alliance implies that one is in alliance with other partners . 
it seems like it is the same old reform party . 
he said that children will suffer . 
i find this to be quite outrageous and insulting . 
that is what he said . 
children are certainly suffering because of poverty . 
i want to call the member on this issue . 
that kind of debate is *UNK* and *UNK* . 
the member for yorkton-melville went even further in his attack . 
we should reject that . 
we can see what is happening . 
this party has respect for and commitment to that . 
mr. werner schmidt ( kelowna , canadian alliance ) : 
the first has to do with the matter of definitions . 
that is the purpose of the amendment . 
i know i certainly would . 
why should we care so much about the definition ? 
he then asked ``what is *UNK* ' ' 
science is the orderly arrangement of knowledge . 
there we have it . 
what is in a definition ? 
that is not regressive . 
that is not the point . 
they are not marriage . 
it seems to me that is very fundamental . 
a *UNK* is not the same as a *UNK* . 
the head is not the same as a *UNK* . 
however , they are part of a body . 
if not , what happens ? 
that is what we need . 
it is very interesting to see what happens . 
first , there is confusion . 
what is it we are talking about ? 
it is a matter of opinion , a matter of interpretation . 
the gentleman goes on to say : 
that is what we are asking the government to do . 
is that not pretty clear ? 
i encourage the government to do that . 
do it . 
we are not here to condemn the government . 
we are not here to oppose the government . 
mrs. diane ablonczy ( calgary-nose hill , canadian alliance ) : 
this is a very difficult issue for members of parliament . 
this is a very difficult area . 
those feelings are legitimate . 
closure was introduced on this bill already . 
we know that there can be a battle of legal opinions . 
mr. monte solberg ( medicine hat , canadian alliance ) : 
why are canadians concerned about bill c-23 ? 
that is the question we need to answer . 
there is no big open debate . 
it is part of our tradition . 
what is tradition ? 
it refused . 
in fact , we have a legal opinion which states that . 
that is where this will be decided . 
he said : 
he goes on to say : 
the government has refused that . 
government members across the way have refused it . 
it is a *UNK* . 
it does not exist . 
that is the first point that we want to make . 
what does conjugal relationship mean ? 
it does not say in the legislation . 
that is what it seems to mean . 
it is vague . 
we should decide them based on clear definitions . 
we should establish the definitions . 
they want to do the right thing . 
what does tolerance mean ? 
let us get to the bottom of that . 
that is crazy . 
it is fundamental to society . 
mr. bob mills ( red deer , canadian alliance ) : 
let us start with tax unfairness . 
that has not been fixed . 
obviously the finance minister has recognized it . 
a second item is child pornography . 
he is nine *UNK* and doing great . 
the government has not done anything to fix that . 
it would change the law in that regard . 
we cannot have these people being released . 
that is what is happening out there . 
the government is not friendly to families . 
another plan . 
the liberals are great for having plans and programs . 
i could go on . 
how about the marriage courts ? 
how about the problems there ? 
we could talk about the medicare program . 
they do have plans . 
they are doing things . 
i have many quotes . 
mr. john mckay ( scarborough east , lib. ) : 
that and *UNK* will get a cup of coffee *UNK* . 
statistics canada puts it somewhat more *UNK* . 
the results are fairly clear . 
who says that all relationships are created equal ? 
certainly our children know that this is not true . 
those are my comments . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
that is how a democracy works . 
it boggles the mind . 
we have a record in the house . 
what is the government ' s response ? 
i will provide some history . 
i found the statistics from that particular vote . 
it is one or the other . 
these were the numbers in the spring of 1996 . 
that was on the liberal side . 
that also says something . 
*UNK* liberals , 10% . 
that is *UNK* . 
how we have slipped . 
that is shameful . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. john reynolds ( west vancouver-sunshine coast , canadian alliance ) : 
why is that so threatening to some ? 
here are the facts . 
she is just playing the political game . 
who do we believe ? 
it also *UNK* corporate and administrative law . 
i quote what that firm had to say about bill c-23 : 
allow me to quote further from the legal opinion : 
what does that mean ? 
bill c-23 is a very flawed piece of legislation . 
mr. deepak obhrai ( calgary east , canadian alliance ) : 
the bill has opened up the debate on two fronts . 
what is a benefit ? 
to whom would the benefits apply ? 
we had a very interesting discussion . 
that is what we should be *UNK* for . 
we have come a long way in that respect . 
i actually travelled with my colleagues in the bloc . 
the bill is absolutely flawed . 
parliament made quite clear the definition of marriage . 
that is the view of society . 
some of us will have objections to that . 
why not ? 
it is a point of view . 
religious groups are *UNK* about it . 
that is acceptable in society . 
that is a major concern . 
the justice minister has made an amendment . 
mr. jim abbott ( kootenay-columbia , canadian alliance ) : 
conjugal will likely mean *UNK* sexual activity . 
the minister of justice is also a distinguished lawyer . 
this is very troublesome . 
there will be court intrusion . 
here is something that is very troublesome . 
he *UNK* a person to death . 
mr. charles hubbard ( miramichi , lib. ) : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mr. randy white ( langley-abbotsford , canadian alliance ) : 
that is where we continually go wrong . 
it is typical . 
that is what is wrong here . 
i knew them all . 
first of all they did not know much about it . 
that is what many people are trying to say . 
it will be case after case after case . 
where are we coming from ? 
mr. werner schmidt : 
and where are we going ? 
that is the way this group is thinking . 
that is what we expect of them . 
mr. myron thompson ( wild rose , canadian alliance ) : 
it is time for consultation of that nature . 
there has been no consultation with society . 
the government has failed to do that on every count . 
it goes on and on year after year . 
people do not want to live in that kind of society . 
lord only knows what the liberals stand for any more . 
i do not know . 
personally , what it could mean *UNK* me . 
there will be no free vote . 
there will be no consultation with the public . 
the mighty powers of ottawa have spoken . 
sheep should rise and vote the way they are supposed to . 
never mind what the people say in the ridings . 
it will take some initiative over there . 
never mind the *UNK* of our wonderful country . 
we are tired of the *UNK* . 
what about the people ? 
i will be here to *UNK* . 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
i have been called worse names . 
i am not one who *UNK* . 
i was brought up not to hate . 
let us take a look at my own family . 
she never married . 
this government *UNK* marriage . 
there will be that many provincial acts . 
this bill , bill c-23 . 
we see the word conjugal with no definition . 
i do not know where its constituents are . 
are my constituents different from the rest ? 
not on your life . 
let us get the information out . 
let us get the judicial people into each of the provinces . 
has it got the courage to do that ? 
let us wait and see . 
what would the government do then ? 
i ask that question and i ask one favour . 
mr. paul devillers ( simcoe north , lib. ) : 
that is exactly what is happening . 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
mr. darrel stinson ( okanagan-shuswap , canadian alliance ) : 
we will say what has to be said . 
we will say it on behalf of our constituents . 
it will not stop us . 
let us look at bill c-23 . 
*UNK* federal statutes are to be amended . 
it is a *UNK* for them . 
the government is too afraid to define marriage . 
it is a shame . 
yet the government refuses to define it . 
there is concern out there . 
i cannot believe it . 
*UNK* 
that is not addressed . 
they refuse to address it . 
i do not understand it . 
an hon. member : 
it didn ' t happen to you . 
mr. darrel stinson : 
they tell me what they want . 
what is said at that moment means absolutely nothing . 
we all know it and the people of canada know it . 
that is the agenda of the government . 
mr. gurmant grewal ( surrey central , canadian alliance ) : 
what is it that my constituents are opposing ? 
the vast majority supports families . 
i will talk about the definition of marriage for a moment . 
an hon. member : 
because they do not really believe in it . 
mr. gurmant grewal : 
exactly . 
there are other problems . 
the liberals refuse to be clear on who *UNK* . 
how do people know if they qualify ? 
there are two other problems . 
the bill says nothing about that . 
let us talk about cost for a moment . 
canadians have no information about how much it will cost taxpayers . 
who believes them ? 
let us look at the *UNK* policies of the government . 
let us talk about taxes and families . 
we have a *UNK* policy . 
let us talk about child pornography . 
that is the exact text of all 19 of my amendments . 
i received many , many more letters . 
mr. rahim jaffer ( edmonton-strathcona , canadian alliance ) : 
there is obviously much to be said about it . 
unfortunately , the government does not really believe in that . 
a few people have talked about this . 
they want to try to strengthen that . 
i will give an example . 
it is something we fundamentally believe to our core . 
i for one reject that suggestion . 
it was not intended to do that . 
it was never intended to . 
mr. grant mcnally : 
mr. derek lee : 
now he is going to check with his friends . 
that *UNK* obligations as well as benefits . 
they simply end up in the world as one of us . 
it may well continue to grow . 
that is simply a reality that exists in canadian society . 
we have to take account of it . 
two good parents are better than one . 
then we will want to do that for children . 
mr. gary lunn ( saanich-gulf islands , canadian alliance ) : 
there are a couple of points i want to focus on . 
the jury is still out . 
i think that is something on which we should be focusing . 
it is a lost opportunity . 
it wanted a diversion in the house . 
it has not worked . 
all kinds of court cases will result . 
why should dependency be based on a conjugal relationship ? 
what exactly is a conjugal relationship ? 
what i find frustrating is how the house operates . 
that is one of the frustrating aspects for me . 
he basically wanted to remove the *UNK* from it . 
benefits should not be based on *UNK* . 
i think that was the way to go . 
the government has missed an opportunity . 
the government *UNK* made an amendment to the bill . 
i think that still needs to be done . 
the government put this together at the last minute . 
it wanted to get something on the order paper . 
the government does not accept changes . 
adjournment proceedings 
the environment 
hon. charles caccia ( davenport , lib. ) : 
fisheries 
mr. peter stoffer ( sackville-musquodoboit valley-eastern shore , ndp ) : 
that is the reason i asked the question . 
unfortunately the record has been quite shameful over the years . 
my question is : 
they will not accept the *UNK* 
the deputy speaker : 
we are taking these warning signs very seriously . 
conservation of the snow *UNK* resource is the priority . 
the deputy speaker : 
( the house adjourned at *UNK* p.m. )

questions on the order paper 
the deputy speaker : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
supply 
allotted *UNK* audit reports 
mrs. diane ablonczy ( calgary-nose hill , canadian alliance ) moved : 
this is an extremely serious matter . 
it is a shameful situation . 
instead they are being hidden and kept under *UNK* . 
we have had a very difficult time receiving them . 
why are we asking for that ? 
it is completely unacceptable . 
the government has gone into an alarming *UNK* *UNK* . 
big brother is watching . 
this will be our concern for debate today . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
it will not work . 
mrs. diane ablonczy : 
that is not being done . 
mr. reed elley ( nanaimo-cowichan , canadian alliance ) : 
of that i am certain . 
we only wait for the day when it occurs . 
let us look at the reality of the situation . 
does the government meet its own guidelines ? 
unfortunately the government does not even come close . 
that should not come as a great surprise . 
this is not acceptable . 
furthermore , it is not right . 
in conclusion , i move : 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
the question is on the amendment . 
the hon. member for waterloo-wellington . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
they should apologize . 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. lynn myers : 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. lynn myers : 
i really could not ' ' . 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the last presentation was made by the member for nanaimo-cowichan . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. lynn myers : 
it really is outrageous . 
mr. reed elley : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i feel very *UNK* by the member . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. lynn myers : 
i will , mr. speaker . 
your judgment , as always , is dead on . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. reed elley : 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
let us think about that for a minute . 
it would add time by approximately 15 days . 
it is appropriate to duly note that . 
it was a very important document . 
that is important to note . 
that is important . 
i think canadians expect that . 
why did we do that ? 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
i agree with that . 
why does it not release this information in a timely fashion ? 
mr. lynn myers : 
talk about hypocrisy in the extreme . 
mr. rick borotsik ( brandon-souris , pc ) : 
mr. lynn myers : 
mr. steve mahoney ( mississauga west , lib. ) : 
they might disagree with the direction we take . 
i have no problem with that . 
i want to talk about some of the programs . 
we corrected the problem . 
are these people funded directly by hrdc ? 
he passed away a month ago . 
he would take care of the *UNK* . 
one of the important goals of community living is : 
the *UNK* damage as this *UNK* *UNK* is potentially *UNK* . 
the big issue today is health care . 
we should be debating that issue . 
have we put enough money into health care ? 
mr. garry breitkreuz ( yorkton-melville , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. steve mahoney : 
the government is open . 
the internet can be used . 
let them *UNK* into the auditor general ' s reports . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. speaker , there is a contradiction here . 
the fact is that is not being done . 
that is a debate for another day . 
it could well be . 
however , that is not there . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
they are afraid that some *UNK* is going to show up . 
anyone who wants to contribute to that can contact community living . 
mr. benoît sauvageau ( repentigny , bq ) : 
the motion reads : 
what does that mean ? 
the motion is asking for three things . 
it should be formal , normal procedure . 
ministerial responsibility ought to be restored . 
we do not have a problem with that . 
this is important . 
it can be seen that his role is far more restricted . 
but the minister for international trade has said nothing . 
what happened at human resources development ? 
internal audit reports are important documents and they are *UNK* . 
was there a cover up attempt ? 
what data are contained in the internal audit report ? 
seven categories of programs were *UNK* in the report . 
mr. jean-guy chrétien ( frontenac-mégantic , bq ) : 
they are not asking for an increase . 
they know that budgets have been slashed . 
mr. benoît sauvageau : 
it is up to the premiers ' ' . 
departments should develop *UNK* *UNK* 
it is a bit of a paradox . 
mr. pat martin ( winnipeg centre , ndp ) : 
they are both valid points . 
there are so many issues . 
we could talk about cleaning up the environment . 
that is not being debated in the house of commons today . 
how cruel . 
what a *UNK* comment . 
what a waste of an opportunity and it *UNK* me . 
what does one become when one is no longer a reformer ? 
maybe that is what we should be calling them now . 
we do come from *UNK* opposed positions . 
any public spending is bad . 
all things private are good . 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. pat martin : 
mr. speaker , i am happy to co-operate . 
i will call the party by its proper name . 
it is not like *UNK* a light switch on and off . 
they are not coming back . 
we are fond of saying that some cuts do not heal . 
we do and we appreciate that . 
i am quite proud of that . 
we have watched the federal transfer payments *UNK* . 
ms. libby davies ( vancouver east , ndp ) : 
he said : 
it pointed out some quite alarming facts . 
these are folks who provide financial administration . 
we want to see timely audits that are made public . 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
the pc party is supporting the motion . 
the accountability issue is critical . 
it would benefit all of us . 
we in the pc party are supporting the motion . 
mr. rick borotsik ( brandon-souris , pc ) : 
in fact the motion should have been put forward . 
i am a *UNK* of internal efficiency audits . 
i am a *UNK* of the auditor general . 
mr. *UNK* does his job extremely well . 
members of his staff are extremely competent . 
let me give a little example . 
four specific departments of agriculture were there . 
we had an audit . 
we showed them the deficiencies . 
there has to be a *UNK* . 
there has to be a *UNK* . 
it is an *UNK* of duty . 
that is all the motion speaks to . 
that is fair ball . 
that is wrong , absolutely wrong . 
let us talk just briefly about access to information . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
yet the liberal government members are denying this . 
it is in *UNK* denial . 
mr. rick borotsik : 
i agree . 
that is not correct . 
the member for elk island is absolutely correct . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
the motion before us is an interesting one . 
in fact there were pages and pages of blank paper . 
it had a population of some 200 people . 
i was accountable . 
we do not do that in any other case . 
my very strong *UNK* is that it should . 
here we are offering information ' ' . 
that is wonderful . 
it makes a great press release . 
it makes a great press conference . 
it is not released . 
one of them is being *UNK* . 
we hit a wall . 
we know that . 
it is a contradiction of the whole concept of accountability . 
there is a vast difference in those two concepts . 
to be very *UNK* , that was not true . 
that , to me , is evidence of a cover-up . 
mr. clifford lincoln ( lac-saint-louis , lib. ) : 
mr. ken epp : 
yes , i agree that it is part of its policy . 
mr. derrek konrad ( prince albert , canadian alliance ) : 
nothing has changed . 
there is no information forthcoming from the government . 
i quote from his testimony : 
that is the reason . 
all five are 45 days overdue . 
then there is fisheries and oceans . 
then there is the national capital commission . 
that is not acceptable . 
the answer is obvious . 
mr. lou sekora ( port moody-coquitlam-port coquitlam , lib. ) : 
it is a good budget . 
we gave $2.5 billion in the budget . 
i think that is a very fair comment . 
a management framework for the government of canada ' ' . 
the government has introduced the millennium fund . 
this project looks after *UNK* kids . 
this facility looks after the community . 
these are things that are happening . 
these are things that our government is doing . 
guess what ? 
the reform party voted against it . 
do they support the municipalities that they represent ? 
i have been a politician for going on 28 years . 
i was in municipal politics for 25 years . 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i would like to have him repeat three times after me : 
canadian alliance , canadian alliance , canadian alliance . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. lou sekora : 
it was to become a bingo hall . 
another time- 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. lou sekora : 
they do not believe in it . 
mr. jean-guy chrétien ( frontenac-mégantic , bq ) : 
let him quickly give me three examples . 
mr. lou sekora : 
it is there for health care . 
is there something wrong with being a part of canada ? 
mr. jean-guy chrétien : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i want him to give us three examples . 
the deputy speaker : 
the hon. member for port moody-coquitlam-port coquitlam . 
mr. lou sekora : 
i could go on for *UNK* of hour . 
i came here two years ago . 
we put our political *UNK* aside and everything else . 
no. it does not want to be part of canada . 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
it makes us all feel some measure of achievement . 
it says : 
it is a complex motion . 
the motion raises an important issue . 
this has been the policy of the treasury board since 1995 . 
this is not a reaction . 
this has been our policy since 1995 . 
as a result of that , some 37 files showed deficiencies . 
in the first instance , this motion is talking about audits . 
committees already have the opportunity . 
they are the masters of their own agenda . 
i do not believe that all reports should have reviews . 
as a consequence , i will not be supporting the motion . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
i ' m going to vote against it . 
i don ' t agree with that ' ' . 
what does he propose in its place ? 
does he proposed to hide them forever ? 
does he want to continue to hide it ? 
mr. paul szabo : 
that cannot be clearer . 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
he should admit that the problem is there . 
canadians have now come to expect that from the government . 
mr. paul szabo : 
canadians have a right to know the facts . 
i will not be supporting this . 
ms. val meredith ( south surrey-white rock-langley , canadian alliance ) : 
the hon. member for mississauga south was quite right . 
the memo is very clear . 
it is their money that is being used . 
mr. dennis j. mills : 
we gave you the file . 
ms. val meredith : 
precisely . 
why ? 
it is not one audit . 
and it is not just one department . 
it is their audits as well . 
mr. dennis j. mills ( broadview-greenwood , lib. ) : 
we do not challenge that role . 
there will always be mistakes . 
that is the way life is . 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
mr. dennis j. mills : 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
no , it was *UNK* billion . 
mr. dennis j. mills : 
ms. val meredith : 
mr. antoine dubé ( lévis-et-chutes-de-la-chaudière , bq ) : 
ms. val meredith : 
that has to stop . 
mr. gurmant grewal ( surrey central , canadian alliance ) : 
that is okay . 
who are those managers ? 
it is the liberals who are hiding something . 
i will list some of them . 
it does not want to reply . 
i want to speak about the treasury board guidelines . 
the information commissioner said : 
he further stated : 
it has limited debate many times . 
it has beaten the record of brian mulroney . 
the government denies information . 
it *UNK* facts . 
it *UNK* its own achievements . 
the government time and again has *UNK* a cover-up mentality . 
it will not correct mistakes and rectify the problems . 
we are *UNK* arrogance by the government . 
it abuses its power time and again in the house . 
this attitude is continuing . 
all members in the house should support the motion .

oral question period 
aboriginal affairs 
why will this minister not stand to protect the band members ? 
at election time they will make that decision . 
why is he ignoring them ? 
mr. myron thompson ( wild rose , canadian alliance ) : 
a crisis exists in canada . 
the speaker : 
that is not the policy of this government . 
mr. myron thompson ( wild rose , canadian alliance ) : 
that is what it ought to be . 
others in canada can access an ombudsman . 
aboriginal people on reserve cannot . 
will the minister respond to this request ?

bill *UNK* 
mr. john bryden ( wentworth-burlington , lib. ) : 
the speaker : 
the hon. member is correct . 
we always seek fairness . 
my ruling stands . 
government orders 
supply 
allotted *UNK* audit reports 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
there is a real dilemma . 
there is a huge contradiction . 
mr. gurmant grewal : 
the government is hiding its arrogance . 
the government is becoming more and more arrogant day by day . 
it denies the right to information . 
it forgot what canadians called on it to do . 
we are *UNK* a cover-up mentality . 
the government has a cover-up mentality . 
what it seeks is already available . 
increasingly , decisions are made locally . 
this means operating *UNK* . 
it means taking action when problems arise . 
this study was completed in january . 
a management framework for the government of canada ' ' . 
canadians do not need more red tape . 
mr. grant mcnally ( dewdney-alouette , canadian alliance ) : 
she is asking a lot . 
yet she and her department refuse to release them . 
why is that ? 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
hon. lucienne robillard : 
what does this mean ? 
it is extremely transparent . 
all these reports can be made public immediately . 
mr. reed elley ( nanaimo-cowichan , canadian alliance ) : 
hon. lucienne robillard : 
that is what i am saying . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
she talks about modern management practices . 
modern management practices require some accountability . 
how can this motion move us away from what we want ? 
hon. lucienne robillard : 
it has been around since 1994 . 
i have never known of a single one . 
there has always been . 
they can do so at any time . 
they have the power of initiative in each of the committees . 
mr. rick borotsik ( brandon-souris , pc ) : 
hon. lucienne robillard : 
we make the distinction here . 
mr. grant mcnally ( dewdney-alouette , canadian alliance ) : 
i will ask the minister once again . 
hon. lucienne robillard : 
we will actively monitor this policy . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
that public information included audit reports . 
i heard the minister say that . 
that is why we brought this motion forward . 
in recent times something has changed . 
there are five more reports that we are waiting for . 
it does not stop at hrdc . 
this delay tactic seems to be *UNK* . 
it is not only hrdc . 
this delay approach is *UNK* to other departments . 
when did all this start ? 
the problem is that this is causing increasing delays . 
how big are the problems ? 
it is more than 45 days . 
we have been waiting 45 days . 
apparently it is taking more and more . 
what is being hidden here ? 
let us look at the hrdc audit for a moment . 
that is what the motion is all about . 
we look forward to them supporting it . 
mr. rey d. pagtakhan ( winnipeg north-st . 
a management framework for the government of canada ' ' . 
mr. eric lowther : 
mr. rey d. pagtakhan : 
mr. eric lowther : 
mr. grant mcnally ( dewdney-alouette , canadian alliance ) : 
let us take a look at them . 
it is unbelievable and it cannot be hidden . 
we see it *UNK* to other departments now . 
it cannot hide from that reality . 
canadians are not happy about it at all . 
here is a question within an internal document : 
why doesn ' t management make up its mind ? 
that is unbelievable . 
what does that *UNK* ? 
another question was : 
so what are the new rules ? 
the rules are not new . 
that is simply wrong . 
the answer was : 
this is not an option . 
canadians need to know this . 
what are its actions ? 
it is almost like the *UNK* of *UNK* . 
it is amazing . 
they will be appalled . 
the government should be and needs to be held accountable . 
that is why we brought this motion forward . 
mr. dennis j. mills ( broadview-greenwood , lib. ) : 
we do not have a problem with that . 
what do i mean by that ? 
we have to speak up and defend the officials . 
i see one of the members shaking his head no . 
i think canadians see through that . 
that *UNK* aspersions on the public service . 
boy , did they ever make a mistake there . 
its economic track record shows us that . 
to try to *UNK* *UNK* is really a shame . 
* * * 
business of the house 
mr. bob kilger ( stormont-dundas-charlottenburgh , lib. ) :

mr. grant mcnally ( dewdney-alouette , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. dennis j. mills : 
we have him up to 13 . 
mr. grant mcnally : 
the hon. member will not listen . 
i am only stating the facts . 
i do not think he would disagree with that . 
he said it about nine different times . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
that is the question . 
the hon. member for broadview-greenwood . 
mr. dennis j. mills : 
canadians know that we make mistakes . 
that is my point . 
mr. grant mcnally : 
mr. speaker , again we have seen the *UNK* defence . 
mr. dennis j. mills : 
mr. speaker , this is really amazing . 
mr. john bryden ( wentworth-burlington , lib. ) : 
i was referring to the rhetoric coming from the other side . 
i must correct myself on that . 
mr. grant mcnally : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
mr. john bryden : 
it does not support it at all . 
but we will see . 
this is a huge area of secrecy . 
mr. speaker , i am in despair with them . 
i just do not know what i can do with them . 
this is a government that stands for transparency . 
mr. werner schmidt ( kelowna , canadian alliance ) : 
i could not agree more . 
i do not disagree with that at all . 
he has not explained that to me at all . 
would he please remember that is the case . 
mr. john bryden : 
mr. rick borotsik ( brandon-souris , pc ) : 
it is true by the way . 
i am very familiar with performance and *UNK* audits . 
mr. john bryden : 
it has not been *UNK* or *UNK* since that time . 
i think we are headed in the right direction . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. garry breitkreuz ( yorkton-melville , canadian alliance ) : 
government members really do not listen . 
the government delays its release . 
hon. members have heard that right , almost a year . 
there are other problems . 
what are some of the other problems ? 
it gets even worse than that . 
here is what i found out . 
i will give a preamble . 
here is the *UNK* . 
let me say this . 
this strikes to the very heart of democracy . 
there must be a free exchange of information . 
democracy just cannot work . 
they should know where that money is . 
we are talking big bucks . 
that really *UNK* democracy . 
it was completely *UNK* out . 
mr. john bryden ( wentworth-burlington , lib. ) : 
mr. speaker , did i really hear right ? 
that is exactly what he said . 
mr. garry breitkreuz : 
mr. speaker , the member has asked two good questions . 
the government has a deliberate strategy to confuse . 
that is the point i was trying to make . 
that is the problem . 
mr. john bryden : 
therefore , the will is here . 
i have to stress that i am a *UNK* too . 
there is nothing wrong with that . 
mr. garry breitkreuz : 
i really resent that . 
that is my main point . 
let us not lose sight of that . 
mr. werner schmidt ( kelowna , canadian alliance ) : 
i appreciate that very much . 
we are talking about audits . 
audits have been divided by various groups into different kinds . 
in fact i wish to speak about financial audits primarily . 
that is what we are talking about this afternoon . 
where is it going ? 
that has to do with the budget . 
these are estimates that are added to the original budget . 
the budget is the guiding document . 
it is the policy document . 
in fact the budget is a piece of legislation . 
to whom should that account be given ? 
it is money that is held in trust . 
did the government deliver the projects and programs ? 
that is the first level of accountability . 
if more was spent , why ? 
the budget also *UNK* responsibility . 
this is your responsibility . 
that becomes the issue . 
what is meant by honesty ? 
that is honesty . 
why would they not want to let out this information ? 
it is a cover-up of some kind . 
that openness has to be guaranteed . 
whose money is this ? 
who made the decision ? 
it had the money . 
what is going on ? 
why does it have to consult a third party ? 
the corporation is responsible . 
the minister is responsible . 
i am here to hold the government to account . 
the government should not be afraid . 
mr. john bryden ( wentworth-burlington , lib. ) : 
it seems to me we are talking about two things . 
mr. werner schmidt : 
we could call it a performance audit , if we wished . 
that is what they want . 
that they do not want . 
that is exactly what we want . 
he knows that i have a lot of respect for him . 
maybe i have not asked the right questions . 
voters in canada are well informed . 
they are thoughtful and intelligent . 
i would be surprised if his voters are really that *UNK* . 
mr. werner schmidt : 
we are kind of *UNK* people . 
we do have this kind of thing . 
we do have a *UNK* toward doing that . 
we want to avoid that . 
that is the issue . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. john o ' reilly ( haliburton-victoria-brock , lib. ) : 
of course we would like more money . 
who would not ? 
i think that is normal . 
does he have dairy farms ? 
mr. john bryden : 
i do so . 
mr. john o ' reilly : 
the internal *UNK* is a great resource . 
many thousands of canadians depend on these programs . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
private members ' business 
first nations ombudsman act 
mr. darrel stinson ( okanagan-shuswap , canadian alliance ) : 
we are into the final hour of debate . 
i have listened to their concerns . 
i had a speech for tonight . 
it states : 
*UNK* is widespread . 
they do whatever they want . 
their criminal activities are *UNK* . 
it will give members something to think about . 
we went to meeting after meeting . 
this is what is going on . 
i will now quote some examples given by a judge . 
does the government listen to the grassroots people ? 
mr. john o ' reilly ( haliburton-victoria-brock , lib. ) : 
we take a different view . 
our government would rather work with first *UNK* 
mr. myron thompson : 
madam speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
mr. john o ' reilly : 
first nations must have *UNK* . 
they cannot have a continued state of dependency . 
mr. andré harvey ( chicoutimi , pc ) : 
this bill is nothing new . 
the federal government could draw a lesson from all of this . 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
third , we had three public meetings in the constituency . 
some very interesting things came out of this process . 
it is not only the eight reserves in my constituency . 
this is what was said in one presentation : 
an advocate , or an arm ' *UNK* agency . 
that was a point which was made very clear . 
he is abdicating his responsibility . 
``it seems like a *UNK* situation ' ' , they said . 
that is the way he talks . 
i believe that that is the case . 
they have not been dealt with . 
one hand out of the 70 went up . 
all the hands went up except one . 
i hope everyone in the house will support this bill . 
mr. jim abbott ( kootenay-columbia , canadian alliance ) : 
we were *UNK* by six women . 
she had no place to go . 
that is not the end of the story . 
along with self-government there must be the position of ombudsman . 
mr. david iftody : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
mr. myron thompson ( wild rose , canadian alliance ) :

might this new method be to go the american way ?

motion no. *UNK* 
mr. derek lee : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
the motion is transferred for debate . 
mr. derek lee : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is it agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
mr. mark muise : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
surely the government would want to make this *UNK* public . 
mr. derek lee : 
mr. rick casson : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
[ english ] 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
hon. jim peterson : 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the co-operation of hon. members . 
mr. dale johnston : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i do not think you heard that . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
hon. jim peterson : 
there are expanded means , including the internet . 
where there is a suspicious *UNK* , it must be reported . 
we will have three types of reporting . 
second , there will be mandatory reporting of prescribed transactions . 
those are the guts of the new law . 
we have *UNK* . 
the centre must satisfy itself first . 
what does the centre pass on ? 
this is through using this unique concept of the centre . 
the centre will be able to *UNK* *UNK* in money laundering . 
we will appreciate the support of all parties . 
it is a substantial problem . 
we take these concerns very seriously . 
mr. gurmant grewal ( surrey central , canadian alliance ) : 
i would also like to provide some suggestions and amendments . 
they have to do that to continue their illegal operations . 
it is a wide open area . 
these activities make our streets *UNK* . 
someone else can sit in the driver ' s seat . 
a canadian alliance government would do that . 
canadians are fed up and have had enough . 
why has the reporting been voluntary in the first place ? 
this does not make sense . 
it thinks that the status quo is the only option . 
what is the reason ? 
there are so many loopholes and the criminals are *UNK* them . 
the whole nation *UNK* . 
that is what canadians are telling us . 
that is the only way to discourage them . 
we all know those figures . 
no , i do not think so . 
these definitions are not given in this bill . 
we do not know what they mean . 
they are too vague . 
i will come to that later . 
the bill is too vague in many areas . 
the liberals have to show us clarity in this bill . 
there is a lack of *UNK* in this bill . 
what is a suspicious *UNK* ? 
there is no definition . 
the government has overall authority to make those regulations . 
that is dangerous . 
it should be needs based . 
everything is hidden in these regulations . 
nothing has been clearly defined in the bill . 
let us talk about regulations . 
every small business will sue the government . 
*UNK* ministers have kept the stonewalling going . 
that is shameful . 
i have criticized this bill enough . 
i will call them proposed amendments . 
there should be *UNK* in the legislation . 
witnesses before the committees must be representative of a *UNK* . 
as it is written , it is very vague . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. yvan loubier ( saint-hyacinthe-bagot , bq ) : 
this is a major problem . 
there are human tragedies behind these figures . 
therefore , we can no longer talk about a soft drug . 
all drugs are becoming hard drugs . 
this is quite a sum of money . 
why was that so important ? 
it also *UNK* money laundering . 
the small *UNK* weigh 120 *UNK* . 
it would be a lot easier . 
it is something that we have often talked about here . 
these farmers receive death threats . 
they are told their children could be harmed . 
we had the opportunity to discuss that . 
it take time to build up this trust . 
they do so on a voluntary basis . 
we feel this is an improvement . 
there are also provisions for co-operation with foreign countries . 
we must never forget this . 
co-operation between governments is essential . 
this may be beneficial . 
we have *UNK* about this . 
next week , the justice subcommittee will be meeting . 
i would like to send a message to the government . 
the hopes of several thousand people rest on that subcommittee . 
i do not say that as a figure of speech . 
that is undeniable . 
i bring this message to the government . 
we must see improvements . 
hon. jim peterson : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. john solomon ( regina-lumsden-lake centre , ndp ) : 
the ndp supports this bill in principle . 
i would use two examples . 
the *UNK* went from smuggling tobacco to smuggling guns . 
what did the government do ? 
in fact , it was not doing a *UNK* thing . 
nothing has changed . 
it is a feel good piece of legislation . 
more and more people are using the internet . 
it is actually quite nice . 
strict guidelines must be established . 
hon. ralph e. goodale : 
it is there . 
it is up and running in *UNK* . 
mr. john solomon : 
it is up and running in *UNK* ? 
hon. ralph e. goodale : 
it has been there for two years now . 
mr. john solomon : 
he should have invited me to the opening . 
he has to be more co-operative . 
i am glad to see that is happening . 
one of his promises has been completed . 
in summary , we support the bill in principle . 
it has many more positive things to address . 
it could also address some of the farm crisis . 
mr. john solomon : 
guess who pays the *UNK* ? 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
private members ' business 
competition act 
speaker ' s ruling 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
motion no. 1 will be debated and voted on . 
i shall now put motion no. 1 to the house . 
motions in amendment 
mr. pierre brien ( témiscamingue , bq ) moved : 
motion no. 1 
`` ( 2.1 ) 
for example , banks sometimes have a promotion . 
it is free for three months . 
that is not negative option *UNK* . 
we are *UNK* the terms of the act . 
mr. roger gallaway ( sarnia-lambton , lib. ) : 
i will quote his question : 
i quote : 
if the- 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
order , please . 
i ask all members to show a little respect . 
mr. roger gallaway : 
mr. charlie penson ( peace river , canadian alliance ) : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
is the hon. member asking to split his time ? 
mr. charlie penson : 
no , madam speaker . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
very good . 
mr. charlie penson : 
i do not think that it would be a serious matter . 
the bill is in proper balance . 
that is a very good provision in the bill . 
mr. john solomon ( regina-lumsden-lake centre , ndp ) : 
the bill is remarkable for several reasons . 
more on that later . 
they have *UNK* legislation which actually protects consumers . 
they have competition legislation which actually encourages competition . 
they call it the competition act . 
there are arguments in favour and against . 
the bloc will not defeat it in the house . 
we wish him luck in the senate . 
mr. jim jones ( markham , pc ) : 
this relationship is simple . 
this is only logical . 
does this sound fair ? 
does this sound right ? 
how can we do this ? 
we can start by passing this bill , bill *UNK* . 
mr. antoine dubé ( lévis-et-chutes-de-la-chaudière , bq ) : 
our objections are based on the constitution . 
yet this is clearly a provincial jurisdiction . 
the same is true for health . 
i was an observer at their last convention . 
the group asked : 
it also asked : 
it also asked : 
none of these recommendations was *UNK* . 
cable companies have a monopoly in the industry . 
should that apply to the banks ? 
the principle is the same . 
i would submit that it is not . 
that is a reality . 
what is the bank supposed to do ? 
it has seven million customers . 
what does the bank do now ? 
that is what is happening . 
the irony is the banks are doing this right now . 
mr. gurmant grewal ( surrey central , canadian alliance ) : 
those are the important questions . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
adjournment proceedings 
the environment 
mrs. karen kraft sloan ( york north , lib. ) : 
towards pollution prevention ' ' , *UNK* 141 recommendations . 
human resources development 
mr. inky mark ( dauphin-swan river , canadian alliance ) : 
madam speaker , the hrdc *UNK* will just not go away . 
the hrdc problem is the tip of the iceberg . 
this is unbelievable . 
but at what cost ? 
here are some examples . 
let us take a look . 
he later pleaded guilty . 
there seems to be no end to the *UNK* affair . 
it states : 
there are many reasons why these problems have *UNK* . 
after all , the buck stops with the politicians . 
the money belongs to the people . 
shipbuilding 
mr. antoine dubé ( lévis-et-chutes-de-la-chaudière , bq ) : 
maybe he made a mistake ? 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) :

mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
these will certainly *UNK* out the substance of the bill . 
this certainly *UNK* the seriousness and the punitive sanctions reflect this . 
it is an embarrassment for our country . 
let us put this into perspective . 
we suggest this is still not enough . 
in rural areas this is of extreme concern . 
this is part of a larger problem . 
what about the exemption for *UNK* ? 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
mr. peter mackay : 
mr. speaker , i want to thank my colleague from kings-hants . 
i know he is greatly concerned with this issue . 
the question was very *UNK* . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
it is often a question of priorities . 
i am sure he will say yes . 
mr. peter mackay : 
we will not follow that path . 
the centre can be a centre of excellence . 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
i would like the member to comment . 
mr. peter mackay : 
mr. jim abbott ( kootenay-columbia , canadian alliance ) : 
what is involved ? 
i do not understand . 
it is important that the government get on with it . 
the article reads : 
it is that serious ' ' . 
that was a quote by an rcmp deputy commissioner . 
the article continues : 
you can ' t smell it . 
that is where we are . 
they *UNK* money in order to continue their illegal operations . 
financial transactions *UNK* criminal profits to make them appear legitimate . 
what about those investors ? 
capital investment is what *UNK* an economy . 
this is an exceptionally serious issue . 
some concerns have been raised about the legislation . 
a writer in the financial post , *UNK* *UNK* , indicated : 
there are *UNK* under criminal law . 
i have read that : 
that is not the point . 
let us deal with the funding issues of this legislation . 
those people also put their lives on the line . 
we will be supporting this legislation but not *UNK* . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
i will be interested in his response . 
mr. jim abbott : 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the question from the member . 
how much time is required ? 
mr. michel bellehumeur ( berthier-montcalm , bq ) : 
this is unacceptable . 
mr. jim abbott : 
i commend the bloc quebecois for that . 
mr. michel bellehumeur ( berthier-montcalm , bq ) : 
what exactly is *UNK* laundering ' ' ? 
far from enough . 
there is a problem . 
he can decide to go back to his country of origin . 
the government should have been much more proactive . 
it should have listened to the bloc quebecois . 
that is a bit *UNK* . 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
i have some concerns about that . 
i have some concerns about that . 
i am also concerned about the budget of the agency . 
that is absolutely , fundamentally wrong . 
the two agencies have to be separate . 
those are my *UNK* . 
again these border on questions of resources . 
a lot of these technologies exist in the private sector . 
mr. john williams ( st. albert , canadian alliance ) : 
that is shocking . 
the *UNK* have their own air forces . 
this is a scourge on our society . 
i want to *UNK* the debate . 
we see *UNK* and corruption in all parts of the world . 
there are horrendous problems in south america . 
members may have read about it in the paper . 
it is everywhere . 
we read about it in the papers in the united states . 
numerous elected officials in senior positions have been bought . 
it goes on . 
what has happened since then ? 
why were they not done properly before ? 
it gets *UNK* . 
we need economic development . 
these are small *UNK* . 
then they would continue their daily *UNK* . 
it is a core part of policy making . 
human rights is the same . 
we have agreements and *UNK* . 
it is everywhere . 
the deputy speaker : 
is the house ready for the question ? 
some hon. members : 
question . 
the deputy speaker : 
the house has heard the terms of the motion . 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
an hon. member : 
on division . 
the deputy speaker : 
i declare the motion carried . 
* * * 
income tax amendments act , 1999 
i have more examples . 
the 1999 budget removes this *UNK* . 
many provinces provide similar assistance . 
each *UNK* the operation of the tax system . 
mr. paul forseth ( new westminster-coquitlam-burnaby , canadian alliance ) : 
voters must understand that liberals cannot manage . 
the *UNK* picture is not great . 
why would they ? 
there is a brain drain from the universities . 
sadly , we still have a cultural *UNK* to economic success . 
we should have been *UNK* more in reducing the national debt . 
this applies to the country as well . 
hardly . 
that again is the liberal record . 
this approach has two problems . 
it was a wrong choice . 
we are not out of the *UNK* . 
our national balance sheet is far from strong . 
they want more groceries . 
*UNK* words were never spoken . 
the more we have *UNK* , the worse it gets . 
there is no question that they should resign . 
they made a cruel *UNK* choice . 
that is what it appears to be . 
one expert said : 
this puts a *UNK* on this taxpayer friendly budget . 
the prime minister calls it a minor administrative problem . 
a danger . 
what is wrong with this ? 
it leads to accounting *UNK* . 
a single rate system of taxation would do something else . 
it would end the penalty for hard work and success . 
it would increase take home pay . 
they are wasting it and *UNK* it . 
the speaker : 
i see the hon. member has finished his speech .

mr. speaker , the hon. member has an unusual attitude . 
to that party it was dead .

government orders 
income tax amendments act , 1999 
mr. yvan loubier ( saint-hyacinthe-bagot , bq ) : 
hon. members need only to look at the figures . 
that was at the end of february . 
that is a bit of a difference . 
there is no doubt about it . 
they have not been minor mistakes . 
this does not give us the range of options . 
this is what the minister is doing . 
let me give you an example . 
just do the calculation . 
this will not even buy a cup of coffee . 
you are a middle income *UNK* . 
it is sad . 
hon. members see the imbalance here . 
this could have been brought back into balance . 
yet he has done nothing . 
he has pushed them into poverty . 
he has thrown them into the *UNK* of poverty . 
he could have changed the plan . 
they *UNK* their *UNK* , they give them *UNK* money . 
the friends of the party are not treated like *UNK* . 
when will he do so ? 
ontario won the prize . 
the liberals make political *UNK* with it . 
they play petty politics . 
why ? 
we made adjustments . 
we will vote against bill c-25 at second reading . 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
i will quote mr. *UNK* . 
they are staying in the *UNK* . 
these are very troubling and not simply *UNK* experiences . 
these are signs of a greater truth . 
these types of statistics are very troubling for canada . 
that step was one of vision and of leadership . 
mr. john mckay : 
mr. scott brison : 
i appreciate that . 
it is tremendously kind . 
canadians deserve much better . 
the 1999 budget was the health care budget . 
what about corporate taxes ? 
that is a step in the right direction . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
* * * 
crimes against humanity act 
stories from rwanda by philip *UNK* . 
that is the basic question we are here to decide . 
it begins to establish basic principles . 
it is absolutely not the case . 
some *UNK* countries have already signed the treaty . 
eight have now ratified it . 
that is really the break from the past . 
however , this time there was a difference . 
they stayed behind . 
they too were murdered by the *UNK* . 
humanity can stand up to crimes . 
we can stand up against *UNK* . 
mr. gurmant grewal ( surrey central , canadian alliance ) : 
he did a great job . 
this is a very important justice issue . 
criminals must be brought to accountability . 
ethnic war is wrong . 
i also had business there . 
i have two sons who were born there . 
now they are 17 and 14 years old . 
the civil war was based on the *UNK* of the people . 
they were killing people . 
they were *UNK* . 
why did they do that ? 
because someone was leading them . 
the canadian alliance supports the bill in principle . 
our support is conditional . 
we should not be part of a rubber stamp process . 
he left the chamber . 
what would the bill do ? 
there are many good parts to the bill . 
it places further emphasis on *UNK* the interests of victims . 
the judges and *UNK* will be completely independent . 
this has always been the case in canadian law . 
it will be *UNK* in the *UNK* , *UNK* . 
i will now go back to the part about the costs . 
we can see how the cost operates . 
there are some questions relating to the *UNK* . 
there are some other problems . 
global judicial rulings should not be deemed regressive . 
it ensures continuity and consistency of international law . 
let me mention something about our neighbours , the united states . 
some may argue that this makes the court ineffective . 
the need for international justice can still be carried out . 
we know that the negotiations are secret . 
mr. svend j. robinson ( burnaby-douglas , ndp ) : 
we demand that we make a list of all those people . 
what are we waiting for *UNK* these families ? 
destroy them . 
he remains *UNK* . 
canada must not just *UNK* this individual . 
i support the bill . 
i salute the government not just for bringing the bill forward . 
it is not just of our government . 
it included many churches . 
it included amnesty international and many other canadian *UNK* . 
his book was entitled none is too many . 
those are very important provisions . 
we cannot have it both ways . 
a bridge was *UNK* by nato in broad *UNK* . 
i believe that indeed they must face that *UNK* . 
i want to be very clear . 
it is as *UNK* and as simple as that . 
sixty are needed before it comes into force . 
those are our concerns . 
that has been the truth too long on our planet . 
mr. dennis gruending ( saskatoon-rosetown-biggar , ndp ) : 
it would seem to me there is an interest there . 
mr. svend j. robinson : 
mr. speaker , i thank my hon. colleague for his question . 
ms. louise hardy ( yukon , ndp ) : 
mr. svend j. robinson : 
the deputy speaker : 
is the house ready for the question ? 
mr. bob kilger : 
the deputy speaker : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
private members ' business 
international organizations 
we intend to participate very actively . 
mr. gurmant grewal ( surrey central , canadian alliance ) : 
the deputy speaker : 
the amendment is in order . 
the question is on the amendment . 
mr. bill blaikie ( winnipeg-transcona , ndp ) : 
this sort of thing continues to this very day . 
when push comes to *UNK* , capital must be protected . 
it really does not matter as long as it is *UNK* . 
they had a name for this in the *UNK* . 
the motion also mentions the united nations . 
mr. andré harvey ( chicoutimi , pc ) : 
these issues are not always very obvious . 
there are many who question its existence . 
i think this is an important step . 
perhaps we should make a greater use of *UNK* . 
i think we must give that very serious consideration . 
mr. jim hart ( okanagan-coquihalla , canadian alliance ) : 
the status quo has become *UNK* . 
this has literally gutted the canadian armed forces . 
what a ludicrous argument . 
the idea is unworkable . 
soldiers on the ground are what the army needs . 
these changes continue today . 
mr. art hanger ( calgary northeast , canadian alliance ) : 
he suggested a spot in canada . 
certainly there have been *UNK* responses in the past . 
there is a conflict *UNK* right now in sudan . 
i am going to touch on the military initiative . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
( the house adjourned at *UNK* p.m. )

government orders 
income tax amendments act , 1999 
mr. jim hart ( okanagan-coquihalla , canadian alliance ) : 
that is a very important step . 
this was supposed to be a tax relief budget . 
canadians are not so fortunate . 
it goes on and on . 
that is what canadians are saying must not happen . 
that was in january . 
the provinces are upset about this and rightly so . 
this is unacceptable . 
i will continue to do this . 
it has to look for funding from other sources . 
the government should also do something . 
we want to see changes . 
the country wants to see changes . 
is the liberal government up to the challenge ? 
i think the answer is no . 
mr. jim hart : 
the provinces want to have more control over their funding . 
does it do that ? 
no , it does not . 
that is what his party stands for . 
i am , too . 
hon. lorne nystrom : 
my question is very simple . 
that is what *UNK* day is saying . 
does he agree with that ? 
mr. jim hart : 
there are mismanagement issues that have to be dealt with . 
that creates frustration . 
the level of funding to health care should be restored . 
that should be addressed . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
i think that canadians are quite willing to pay taxes . 
one grant in particular stands out . 
canadians are frustrated . 
mr. jim hart : 
mr. speaker , i thank the member for his question . 
it is not used for job *UNK* or job creation . 
the government does not create jobs . 
people who think that the government actually creates jobs are wrong . 
canadian dollars should be left to canadians . 
an hon. member : 
the canadian alliance . 
hon. lorne nystrom : 
the canadian alliance . 
i get mixed up . 
he is *UNK* to lead that party . 
the article read : 
it is far out in *UNK* land . 
that idea was rejected back in *UNK* . 
is that the kind of vision we want ? 
is that the kind of country we want ? 
i suggest not . 
that has not happened . 
the gst is still here today . 
she put her seat on the line in a byelection . 
they have not kept their word . 
i suggest that is not good enough . 
he enjoyed the *UNK* . 
that is what should be done . 
that is becoming a very important issue today . 
that is the canadian way .

government orders 
income tax amendments act , 1999 
mr. speaker , i want to summarize . 
it is *UNK* the medical care system . 
that is very significant . 
the crisis is still there . 
*UNK* are up , reaching a record high . 
the last point i mention is the system of education . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
hon. lorne nystrom : 
that is not the case today . 
ms. bev desjarlais ( churchill , ndp ) : 
hon. lorne nystrom : 
that might be acceptable in the case of the senate . 
mr. andré harvey ( chicoutimi , pc ) : 
that is the way it is done usually . 
i can say this however . 
what did the liberals do ? 
they increased taxes 50 times . 
consider how much they benefit from free trade . 
the government did absolutely nothing . 
do members know what that led to ? 
i often have to say *UNK* , quick ' ' . 
why not follow the example of *UNK* ? 
that is the same level as in 1984 . 
what does it do ? 
you passed legislation on referendum clarity ' ' . 
this still just *UNK* the surface . 
it is a bit much . 
and we think this is a democracy . 
this means that people are happy ' ' . 
people are not happy . 
he said it this week . 
canadian federalism has been in trouble for 30 years now . 
we know why . 
mr. speaker , you are a well informed man . 
i have a few small things to ask this government . 
health is what is urgent . 
let us give the funding back to provinces . 
let us stop creating new programs . 
let us talk about the millennium scholarship fund . 
people have accepted the gst and free trade . 
that is where the problem lies in canada . 
it is perfection of the sum of all the parts . 
this country is a federation . 
the hon. member talked about confederation . 
how does the hon. member see that *UNK* ? 
mr. andré harvey : 
mr. speaker , i thank my colleague for her question . 
it wants to see the provinces beg . 
he was always speaking from both sides of his mouth . 
it is *UNK* . 
mr. gilles-a . 
mr. andré harvey : 
we will recall the *UNK* lake accord . 
it took five or six liberals , no more . 
it was a historic *UNK* to the development of the country . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
we want to do a reality check on that . 
they are payroll taxes . 
take that off the claim of *UNK* billion . 
that is unbelievable . 
canadians are not going to fall for it . 
canadians are not being fooled by that . 
this is not just my opinion . 
we are moving in the wrong direction . 
its chief executive officer is mr. john *UNK* . 
we agree with him . 
it has to stop . 
we have to turn it around . 
alberta and ontario have realized this . 
it is getting way to big . 
that is the wrong way to go . 
it is shameful . 
it is picking the pockets of the poor . 
why do we tax people with low incomes ? 
that seems abundantly reasonable . 
they do not have to keep *UNK* . 
there is much that is *UNK* about the budget . 
it is a tragedy . 
mr. deepak obhrai ( calgary east , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. eric lowther : 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
however , marginal is the rate paid on each additional dollar . 
in the united states that is not the case . 
mr. eric lowther : 
he should apologize . 
mr. paul szabo : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of privilege . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. eric lowther : 
it is rather bizarre . 
i wonder if he is part of that group . 
mr. eric lowther : 
who knows . 
let us not give up hope . 
why did that person make those statements ? 
let us think about it . 
the deputy speaker : 
order , please . 
* * * 
bill *UNK* allocation motion 
some hon. members : 
private members ' business 
access to information act 
unfortunately , all government legislation *UNK* from the department of justice . 
therefore , i *UNK* to write it myself . 
this is all dramatic stuff . 
openness is a kind of contract . 
the government has to have necessary *UNK* . 
so it goes . 
then i had representations coming from the bureaucracy . 
i had representations from the privy council office . 
they wanted to get in on it as well . 
there are problems in the legislation . 
it is not perfect . 
that was a proposal from the access commissioner . 
these are things that have to be clarified and debated . 
i put it back in the new version . 
this is what my colleagues have to examine . 
mr. gurmant grewal ( surrey central , canadian alliance ) : 
i have mixed feelings . 
the bill has a *UNK* past . 
this bill is in fact regressive . 
who decides that ? 
another thing is the fees . 
there are two standards here . 
this is so undemocratic that it is anti-democratic . 
the government would be pleased if this bill passed . 
is this a new tax ? 
that is the kind of information in the bill . 
we will not be supporting it . 
mr. gerald keddy ( south shore , pc ) : 
i have a *UNK* in closing . 
we need to prevent ministers from *UNK* the process . 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
the reason is that i know the member very well . 
it is something to which the member *UNK* . 
i know there will be some debate on it . 
some of the changes are very complex . 
let me give some examples . 
he wants to *UNK* the notion of openness . 
he states that very clearly in the second amendment . 
that reason alone is enough for the act to be amended . 
we cannot be *UNK* . 
i believe it is an excellent starting point . 
mr. jim hart ( okanagan-coquihalla , canadian alliance ) : 
will the government itself do this ? 
this is absolutely outrageous . 
the deputy speaker :

i recommend that we let the process take its course . 
this is an important issue . 
this is the information we have *UNK* . 
this is our opinion and this is our view ' ' . 
these individuals will do what is right . 
it will not only be these five members doing the work . 
this is a complicated issue . 
the government has taken the *UNK* by the *UNK* . 
it has undertaken an initiative to move forward positively . 
his heart is where it should be . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) :

mr. gerry ritz ( battlefords-lloydminster , canadian alliance ) : 
it is getting to be a habit . 
it is all the time . 
it sounds very familiar . 
public pressure finally got to her . 
canadians will not be fooled by that . 
lone parent families are becoming more numerous . 
i do not need to exaggerate . 
that is not tolerance or compassion . 
toronto writer *UNK* m. *UNK* is quoted as saying : 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
we know that courts have ruled on this matter . 
it makes no difference . 
this bill strikes a balance . 
quite frankly , this defies common sense . 
common law relationships are not new . 
let us put that to rest once and for all . 
let us put that issue to rest as well . 
on the contrary , this is simply not true . 
this is not a cost issue for the government . 
canadians respect the charter . 
canadians have a great love for the charter . 
why is that ? 
because the charter defines us as a people . 
why is that ? 
why do we do that ? 
because it is the canadian thing to do . 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
it was tabled in the house on february 11 this year . 
we accept and support that move . 
the legislation speaks to benefits and obligations . 
criteria still have to be met and there are obligations attached . 
the hon. member opposite spoke of the financial implications . 
the direction has clearly been *UNK* . 
this is not the only criteria . 
mr. reed elley ( nanaimo-cowichan , canadian alliance ) : 
some of them wanted even more . 
they wanted *UNK* and *UNK* . 
this brings me to the year 2000 . 
this sends a destructive message to all our children . 
what a terrible message to send to our children . 
how will the future of our country be *UNK* by this ? 
what are the youth of today saying ? 
who are these 1995 young people ? 
i look at our nation today and *UNK* . 
mr. joseph volpe ( eglinton-lawrence , lib. ) : 
people want to get their views on the record . 
this is , after all , a charged environment . 
i am not really . 
i am one of those children of the *UNK* . 
however , there is one other element that people have raised . 
no , i do not think anybody is . 
there are *UNK* of religious *UNK* . 
there is *UNK* in everything . 
what dignity is at stake ? 
i would *UNK* give it . 
however , let us do that for every single relationship . 
let us not restrict it by *UNK* . 
mr. maurice vellacott ( wanuskewin , canadian alliance ) : 
i will focus on just a few ideas . 
those words were from the liberal member for wentworth-burlington . 
they ring pretty hollow today . 
that *UNK* *UNK* has operated quite well . 
it is all very *UNK* . 
the institution of marriage has brought great benefits to society . 
our statistics canada studies demonstrate this point . 
why does marriage bring these benefits ? 
this is of great benefit to society . 
it is much more than that . 
we would be killing the *UNK* that *UNK* the golden *UNK* . 
that optimism is good and needs to be encouraged . 
this is something to be welcomed and encouraged . 
we would use the notwithstanding clause to protect kids . 
i could go on from there . 
mr. lee morrison ( cypress hills-grasslands , canadian alliance ) : 
what are its objectives ? 
how can it possibly benefit society ? 
what is the government trying to prove ? 
these relationships have been essentially *UNK*

questions on the order paper 
.[text] 
question no. *UNK* mr. leon e. benoit 
mr. derek lee : 
the deputy speaker : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
mr. lee morrison ( cypress hills-grasslands , canadian alliance ) : 
now we are more civilized . 
that is fair enough . 
marriage is the foundation on which civil society rests . 
that is not just my personal opinion . 
my wife and i do not claim we are *UNK* . 
why should *UNK* pretend that they form a *UNK* ' ' 
what happened ? 
they told it to us over and over and over again . 
what is next ? 
this is *UNK* . 
this is the liberal way . 
this has got to stop . 
it would have been considered *UNK* . 
yet here we are . 
is this progress ? 
i doubt it . 
ms. marlene catterall ( ottawa west-nepean , lib. ) : 
i now have grandchildren . 
we are all a family . 
we have been there and done that . 
they can be brothers and sisters living together . 
that is what the bill is about . 
it is a fact of life . 
the bill says nothing about sex . 
it talks about committed , long term relationships . 
i am married . 
it deals with legal benefits and legal obligations . 
mr. john williams ( st. albert , canadian alliance ) : 
there must be something in it . 
i used the word committed . 
children need our assistance . 
therefore , we need to *UNK* that environment . 
the minister of justice said no . 
the liberal government said no . 
we have to ask that question . 
the supreme court tells us that it is eliminating discrimination . 
in doing so , we now have marriage penalties in law . 
therefore , i have to ask the questions : 
where is our society going ? 
what comes next ? 
the courts have agreed . 
perhaps the answer would be yes . 
where would it stop ? 
marriage is now second class . 
mr. ted mcwhinney ( vancouver quadra , lib. ) : 
i would not discourage them from reading the bill . 
it is not a piece of *UNK* . 
it is a rather *UNK* bill . 
it is a *UNK* of 68 laws . 
anybody who read the bill would find that out . 
it is essentially a *UNK* job . 
but it does not change the definition of marriage . 
it does not add to the fact . 
the bill itself does not do that . 
we speak of *UNK* *UNK* dependency relationships . 
they are relationships of children and parents . 
i understand that will be done . 
it is not exactly *UNK* *UNK* . 
it exists in a more *UNK* form through the common law . 
that is the interesting challenge . 
mr. jim pankiw ( saskatoon-humboldt , canadian alliance ) : 
our health care system is in *UNK* . 
our justice system completely defies logic . 
where is senate reform ? 
there are no free votes . 
the government never *UNK* to the use of referendums . 
it is a dictatorship . 
what are we doing here today ? 
is that the depth to which the government has to sink ? 
what about all the urgent matters facing our nation ? 
it is meaningless . 
the deputy speaker : 
is the house ready for the question . 
some hon. members : 
question ? 
the deputy speaker :

the justice minister knows this . 
we cannot even get through on her *UNK* line . 
we hear them one after another . 
it has sweeping implications for our social structures . 
no provincial voices were heard . 
witness lists were *UNK* . 
this is the third reason . 
ms. sarmite bulte ( parkdale-high park , lib. ) : 
while i was sitting here listening i found that quite *UNK* . 
the ontario government is headed by mr. harris . 
what did that bill do ? 
my riding is in the province of ontario . 
let us look at what the bill is about . 
the purpose of the bill is straightforward . 
that is not true at all . 
she talked about her children . 
we have discussed this legislation with my children . 
the *UNK* had promised him a piece of land . 
she died *UNK* . 
there was nothing left . 
again it is a constitutional question . 
mr. réal ménard ( hochelaga-maisonneuve , bq ) : 
why does it concern democracy ? 
however , the time for that has not yet come . 
the supreme court was faced with the following case . 
this is the case known as m v *UNK* . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. jason kenney ( calgary southeast , canadian alliance ) : 
they are normal working canadians . 
i do not . 
they ought to be heard . 
why do canadians raise those objections ? 
it truly is remarkable . 
is that an *UNK* statement ? 
it will not be used as a reference by the courts . 
do not let it be a partisan vote . 
mr. alex shepherd ( durham , lib. ) : 
i fear we are doing the same thing here . 
why do we support the legislation ? 
this issue comes down to a question of discrimination . 
in other words , things seem to be changing . 
this is the way things were . 
one of the members spoke about her family . 
we must not provide for any discrimination in our system . 
we will continue to debate them . 
that is fair and justified . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
i ask for unanimous consent for that . 
the deputy speaker : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
mr. ken epp : 
i urge members to think seriously about that . 
i urge all members to think very carefully . 
one can hardly argue with those concepts . 
it is a very important question . 
how will it be determined ? 
how do we determine who will be eligible ? 
the definition simply is not there and there is confusion . 
they would qualify . 
there is another huge *UNK* here . 
we know there are certain laws that cover common law relationships . 
how will the courts ever *UNK* that one ? 
it is a *UNK* . 
i ask for unanimous consent once more . 
the deputy speaker : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
mr. john harvard ( charleswood st. james-assiniboia , lib. ) : 
i was first married in *UNK* . 
it does not spread around like that . 
i am not at all surprised by these polling results . 
the provinces have announced their intention to review their laws . 
there was also a time when aboriginal people could not vote . 
what benefits are included in the bill ? 
the bill has been debated for a good long time . 
it has been debated in other *UNK* . 
it has been debated in homes . 
i think people have made up their minds . 
mr. myron thompson ( wild rose , canadian alliance ) : 
i could see it coming . 
there are a lot less liberals . 
it always leads to their *UNK* . 
it only takes time . 
they do not allow that . 
is that democracy ? 
they do not believe in the petition process . 
my desk is full of responses to petitions . 
the petition is laid out on the table . 
the government takes it and it responds . 
the sentence should be simply : *UNK* , folks . 
we are the government . 
we know best ' ' . 
they want to look to the future . 
bill c-23 . 
that will not make a lot of petitioners happy . 
they truly want a voice . 
i promise that day will happen . 
an hon. member : 
it is called a gag law . 
mr. myron thompson : 
it is called a gag law . 
it is really sad . 
we are supposed to look at everything *UNK* . 
those people over there like a lot of humour . 
in my *UNK* 
mr. john harvard : 
is your name *UNK* *UNK* ? 
where are your *UNK* ? 
mr. lee morrison : 
over there . 
mr. myron thompson : 
mr. randy white : 
madam speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
i am serious . 
let us keep it down a little . 
mr. myron thompson : 
madam speaker , it really does not bother me . 
it just shows their true colours . 
let them carry on . 
mr. ghislain lebel : 
madam speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
i believe we are getting into debate here . 
the hon. member for wild rose . 
mr. myron thompson : 
madam speaker , i thank my hon. colleague from the bloc . 
as i said , they should carry on . 
it shows their true colours . 
it is time to do that . 
they were saying not to worry , not to worry . 
that is not the kind of government people want . 
when will the liberals start doing it ? 
liberal governments will never do it . 
i ask folks out there to get ride of them . 
mr. steve mahoney ( mississauga west , lib. ) : 
it just must be my day . 
they say that . 
let us deal with that just for a second . 
mr. myron thompson : 
*UNK* wants to do that speech in his riding . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
he should settle down . 
let us talk about bill c-23 . 
they are very good people . 
i said *UNK* a minute . 
mr. darrel stinson : 
we will see how you vote on the amendments . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
i have a message regarding that . 
i do not support that . 
i have said that before . 
i have said this before . 
i do not consider it to be *UNK* . 
i understand that to be the case . 
let me use an example . 
is that the kind of society we want ? 
i do not think so . 
i cannot wait to hear the debate . 
it is nonsense . 
that is absolute nonsense . 
the canadian people are saying that we will not discriminate . 
it is as simple as that . 
where do we want to go ? 
i think they do . 
i think that is part of their philosophy . 
that is not the vision of this party . 
do we want to have boot camps ? 
they believe in the *UNK* . 
that is their vision . 
mr. randy white ( langley-abbotsford , canadian alliance ) : 
that is bad . 
an hon. member : 
like me . 
mr. randy white : 
like my colleague from *UNK* current . 
members opposite have to remember that . 
that is sad . 
let ' s include people . 
let ' s make this fair ' ' . 
i happen to know them . 
why ? 
it will *UNK* . 
can you believe it ? 
that issue has been left to the courts . 
who did the government talk to ? 
lobby groups ? 
liberal associations ? 
it is not accurate . 
we have a majority ' ' . 
mr. roger gallaway ( sarnia-lambton , lib. ) : 
only the provinces can legislate with respect to adoption . 
what a lot of nonsense . 
let us look at where this law came from . 
what a lot of nonsense . 
let us look at the whole idea of debate . 
there was no vote . 
it passed on consent . 
what kind of society will we have ? 
it is about *UNK* . 
we will tell people things that are patently not true . 
we will say that we never know who voted on it . 
every vote here is recorded . 
what did we see at queen ' s park ? 
i need to ask again what kind of society they want . 
do they want a society where the majority will dictate ? 
will we have polls for everything ? 
we have recognized that this is the right thing to do . 
let me go to something even more *UNK* or more fundamental . 
that was a constitutional guarantee . 
prince edward island has a constitutional guarantee of four senators . 
that is absolutely correct . 
they indicated that we were attacking marriage . 
it amended 67 provincial statutes . 
it is not this government . 
mr. dick proctor ( palliser , ndp ) : 
his words *UNK* the boundaries between *UNK* and faith communities . 
he writes for an organization called citizens for public justice . 
he said : 
he goes on to say in this interesting document : 
we have had some references to that as well . 
mr. *UNK* said : 
he concludes in this portion of his book : 
an hon. member : 
it is discrimination . 
mr. dick proctor : 
that is what this debate fundamentally comes down to . 
it does not matter what the public opinion polls say . 
it does not matter what the petitions say . 
that is the point that needs to be made . 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
there is a difference . 
discrimination is not exclusively a negative concept . 
there are positive or *UNK* *UNK* within our society . 
we discriminate in favour of aboriginals . 
we have special programs to assist aboriginals . 
now the *UNK* is *UNK* . 
we have taken care of the negative *UNK* . 
the supreme court dealt with it . 
there was a series of cases . 
i think that was the language the court used . 
that is how the *UNK* has *UNK* . 
i understand why there is so much discussion here . 
parliament made that step . 
we should have consulted with our constituents . 
we should have raised legislation . 
the courts did it as a result of that ruling . 
it is quite a small number . 
there are two reasons . 
i believe in the traditional family . 
we do have discrimination in our policy now . 
i gave many examples . 
i believe we can .

bill c-23 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. speaker , i also wish to present a petition . 
we have had petitions every day on this particular topic . 
mr. rick casson ( lethbridge , canadian alliance ) : 
the first petition is three separate ones . 
they would like the bill withdrawn . 
human resources development 
mr. rick casson ( lethbridge , canadian alliance ) : 
these petitioners feel that canadians are overtaxed . 
bill c-23

questions on the order paper 
the deputy speaker : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
bill c-23 reflects this reality . 
premature changes may have *UNK* results . 
it is provincial law . 
the status quo is not an option . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
why is that so important ? 
well , it is a term . 
the government has refused to do that . 
what kind of answer is that ? 
just think how inappropriate that is . 
let me review some of those . 
that caused a big *UNK* across the nation . 
it made recommendations that that should change . 
a few weeks ago we saw the budget . 
the recommendations in that report were not included . 
we went through the whole report process . 
let us talk about another situation . 
we are approaching over half a million signatures . 
petitions are still coming in to my office in *UNK* . 
do members know how long ago that was ? 
cases have been delayed . 
*UNK* have not proceeded . 
we had the tool in the notwithstanding clause . 
it is there to be used . 
that is not the end . 
here is another one . 
children were caught in the middle . 
sometimes the testimony was painful . 
they could not interpret any more . 
lots of money was spent and lots of testimony was heard . 
it was a year of hard work by a large committee . 
our dissenting report was very short . 
was it going to implement the report ? 
was it a priority for the government ? 
what can i tell them ? 
once in a while it mentions the word family . 
it does not deliver . 
the official opposition . 
mr. lou sekora : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. eric lowther : 
they are raising the next generation . 
whose money is funding that national *UNK* program ? 
why not just leave that money with the parents ? 
bill c-23 does deal with marriage . 
the government refuses to do that . 
those are two big flaws in the bill . 
they are excluded . 
we play word games sometimes in the house . 
we all know it . 
they know it does not work for families . 
they know it will not strengthen the canadian family . 
politicians are down near the bottom . 
it does not strengthen our nation . 
it is not too much more complicated than that . 
it sends a very confusing message . 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
the question is on the amendment . 
mr. réal ménard ( hochelaga-maisonneuve , bq ) : 
today , things have changed considerably . 
we have to be prepared to *UNK* people . 
that is nothing to be *UNK* at . 
who was the minister of justice at the time ? 
that was discriminatory treatment . 
these people *UNK* wish to maintain discrimination . 
they are *UNK* . 
what was its finding ? 
i continue : 
i continue : 
indeed , it is desirable . 
we have seen this in the court decisions . 
we see it in political courage . 
i am very happy to be so . 
what is so threatening about it ? 
i come from a traditional family . 
my *UNK* brother has a traditional family . 
they need to support this bill . 
there is nothing in this bill that changes this . 
this debate has been going on for ten years in canada . 
that is what this bill is about . 
that is why this bill is *UNK* . 
ms. libby davies ( vancouver east , ndp ) : 
i would like to speak to what the bill is about . 
in ontario we have seen 67 statutes amended . 
i have also *UNK* 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
ms. libby davies : 
we do legislate equality . 
let us be very clear about that . 
why are they willing to do that ? 
they make comments which divide our society . 
we think it is outrageous . 
this is about equality . 
it is about doing the right thing . 
we should be changing these laws . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
i would ask her to speak to those two issues . 
ms. libby davies : 
i find that incredibly *UNK* . 
i find it incredibly biased and i find it *UNK* . 
i think that is *UNK* . 
that was the original intent of the bill . 
i simply do not agree with that . 
mr. eric lowther : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
ms. libby davies : 
*UNK* it *UNK* protest too much . 
mr. pat martin ( winnipeg centre , ndp ) : 
that was a civil rights movement . 
that is the only term i can use . 
somehow they have been held back . 
the rest of us have moved forward and they have not . 
at that time *UNK* marriages were illegal . 
we have gone beyond that . 
that was silly . 
nothing could be further from the truth . 
mr. peter goldring ( edmonton east , canadian alliance ) : 
four years later and here we are . 
mr. pat martin : 
that has been made in argument before . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
i appreciate there are different opinions on issues . 
it is right in our policy document . 
i can respect that they have a different opinion . 
mr. pat martin : 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
we border on doing that in the *UNK* of this debate . 
this happened as well at the justice committee . 
that was one which the conservative party supported . 
we should be *UNK* what we are doing . 
there are numerous examples that could be *UNK* . 
a very simple principle was set out by that decision . 
this was not a moral judgment . 
justice is supposed to be blind . 
one is not exclusive of the other . 
that is factually incorrect . 
the supreme court held that it 
mr. peter goldring ( edmonton east , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. peter mackay : 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
it is always hard to *UNK* it out . 
maybe he can explain that . 
maybe i have *UNK* his actions . 
mr. peter mackay : 
mr. jim pankiw ( saskatoon-humboldt , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. peter mackay : 
mr. eric lowther : 
mr. peter mackay : 
that is a *UNK* . 
mr. eric lowther : 
that is our party policy . 
mr. peter mackay : 
i will be sharing my time with one of my colleagues . 
i salute the hon. member . 
the hon. member said : 
my father and mother have been married for about 60 years . 
they are worried about whether or not they will be accepted . 
i cannot keep up with the name changes in that party . 
those young people are being further *UNK* . 
it is increasing the risk for them . 
other *UNK* of misinformation keep being *UNK* around here . 
one is that the vast majority of pedophiles are *UNK* . 
they are committing suicide . 
i want to make one final point . 
*UNK* and *UNK* families are strong families . 
*UNK* and *UNK* are parents . 
*UNK* and *UNK* are children . 
they are sisters and brothers . 
they are grandparents . 
there appears to be a number of *UNK* . 
i think we might profit from that definition . 
hon. hedy fry : 
that is really what *UNK* is about . 
to me it is very simple . 
this is a question of equality . 
this is a question of fairness . 
the course in this legislature has not been as *UNK* . 
it does not . 
that has been made abundantly clear . 
it states : 
i will give an example using old age security . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
hon. jim peterson : 
mr. speaker , let me say two things . 
heaven *UNK* , but it was progress . 
mr. rick casson ( lethbridge , canadian alliance ) : 
i want to approach the issue in two separate ways . 
it is a cost issue . 
we should know how many people will be affected . 
we do not know that . 
who defines a conjugal relationship ? 
is that what we are saying ? 
is there that aspect of responsibility ? 
where is the definition ? 
how are we ever going to pull that out ? 
are there additional responsibilities if one falls under the bill ? 
what change will that have for society as a whole ? 
we all know of such relationships . 
there is a lack of public input . 
we have not seen that happen . 
we talk about marriage . 
we did that last june in the house . 
it is simple . 
the motion passed . 
the people have spoken . 
another is the child pornography issue . 
it chose not to do so . 
we wanted to have a registry of sex offenders . 
we need to strengthen families . 
i would like to comment on it a bit . 
we hear about the erosion of the family . 
i would like to know if their families do not count . 
i would like to ask the hon. member that question . 
mr. rick casson : 
families are very important . 
what does that mean ? 
what are the other requirements ? 
where is the definition of *UNK* ? 
mr. julian reed ( halton , lib. ) : 
why would he continue to want to discriminate against them ? 
mr. rick casson : 
i think he missed the point . 
mr. grant mcnally ( dewdney-alouette , canadian alliance ) : 
here are the facts . 
i have not heard that *UNK* by the government . 
that is what she is saying . 
the hon. member is a minister of the crown . 
she seems to be *UNK* of this fact . 
that is what we call intellectual *UNK* . 
that is a tactic employed by this government . 
it is the same tactic that is being used here . 
they are weak and *UNK* arguments *UNK* with name calling . 
that is all they are . 
the minister talked about discriminatory practices . 
what if he is in an arrangement of three people ? 
let us call it a *UNK* . 
the government *UNK* against that . 
in fact , our society is built on it . 
that is a dangerous road to go down as a society . 
what was the government ' s action ? 
a group must be judged on its actions . 
mr. speaker , i have a question for the hon. member . 
it is a very simple one . 
mr. grant mcnally : 
the minister continues not to realize that . 
that is quite surprising . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
it struck me that he is talking about outrageous *UNK* . 
mr. lee morrison : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
that is a little over the top . 
is this a debate or a *UNK* *UNK* ? 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. lynn myers : 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
mr. lynn myers : 
listen to them laugh . 
i remind those members opposite : 
that is who those people are . 
why did they vote in a block ? 
mr. grant mcnally : 
mr. lynn myers : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. grant mcnally : 
what the member says is outrageous . 
mr. john bryden ( wentworth-burlington , lib. ) :

it is another massive *UNK* . 
it is hardly a deal . 
he ended up getting twice as much as he asked for . 
they should be calling their department *UNK* canada ' ' . 
collect more in taxes this year ? 
he was told , *UNK* not worry about it . 
it is okay . 
it will not happen again , we promise ' ' . 
then they were told , *UNK* the cash ' ' . 
why does every single day see another government *UNK* ? 
they cannot understand what it is about . 
mr. john williams ( st. albert , canadian alliance ) : 
let ' s double that ' ' . 
my question for the minister of national revenue is simple . 
where were they when we were working on improving the system ? 
mr. john williams ( st. albert , canadian alliance ) : 
let us continue on . 
they were paid three times . 
the taxpayers paid three times for the same work . 
the question is quite simple . 
it was very difficult .

mr. mike scott ( skeena , canadian alliance ) : 
the situation is complex and urgent . 
mr. mike scott ( skeena , canadian alliance ) : 
why should we believe that gathering strength will make any difference ? 
the auditor general has said so himself . 
how can the minister possibly defend this kind of shameful record ? 
* * * 
genetically modified *UNK* 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
we are going to meet that challenge before *UNK* 
the speaker :

auditor general ' s report 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
this report is almost a carbon copy of the 1990 report . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
the speaker : 
order , please . 
we will hear the minister . 
hon. elinor caplan : 
we are aware of the *UNK* ' s concerns . 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
the common theme here is the mismanagement of the government . 
how can we believe that she will fix the problem now ? 
we have received those resources in the existing budget . 
* * *

some hon. members :

hon. paul martin : 
this particular suggestion was made previously . 
* * * 
immigration 
mr. david price ( compton-stanstead , pc ) : 
it will be tabled when we get into clause by clause . 
government orders 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
i agree with him . 
i find that shocking . 
certainly that was the tone of his comments . 
mr. john bryden : 
mr. eric lowther : 
mr. john bryden : 
i cannot do it . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
mr. lynn myers : 
now , having said that- 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i rise again on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
we are not going to get into this . 
mr. lynn myers : 
in fact , i want to do that right now . 
the bill is not about marriage . 
the proposed legislation is an *UNK* bill . 
the bill goes on to modernize obsolete language . 
i believe canadians ultimately respect this . 
let me go into some detail with respect to these changes . 
in the french language its equivalent is *UNK* de *UNK* . 
i think canadians understand them for what they are . 
we have put them into perspective . 
this is a bill that makes a great deal of sense . 
why did he do that ? 
we in this great parliament of canada need to follow suit . 
that is precisely what we are doing . 
mr. grant mcnally ( dewdney-alouette , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. lynn myers : 
this member speaks of name calling . 
it is unbelievable how they *UNK* . 
but canadians see through that . 
let me get to the question that the hon. member asked . 
they see through it every time . 
mr. darrel stinson ( okanagan-shuswap , canadian alliance ) : 
i would like to ask the member this question . 
i do not see it in that light . 
mr. lynn myers : 
he talks about *UNK* . 
what kind of *UNK* does he have ? 
*UNK* he *UNK* protest too much . 
why ? 
they are the people who talk about grassroots . 
they are the people who talk about free votes . 
what *UNK* . 
what hypocrisy . 
mr. daniel turp ( beauharnois-salaberry , bq ) : 
this bill was passed in june 1993 . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. speaker , i appreciate the hon. member ' s comments . 
mr. daniel turp : 
this debate will have to continue . 
ms. marlene catterall ( ottawa west-nepean , lib. ) : 
maybe he could explain that to our colleague from calgary centre . 
mr. daniel turp : 
mr. gilles duceppe ( laurier-sainte-marie , bq ) : 
here are a few examples . 
these are obligations that did not exist . 
this is a reality that cannot be made to disappear . 
mrs. karen redman ( kitchener centre , lib. ) : 
bill c-23 will provide that in similar circumstances . 
that is something that all canadians should support . 
ms. marlene catterall ( ottawa west-nepean , lib. ) : 
let us look at the provisions of bill c-23 . 
i ask the hon. member , what about lone parent families ? 
are these bad families by *UNK* ? 
i do not think so . 
what a horrendous reference . 
how is amending that provision *UNK* ? 
i think that *UNK* society . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
she made some valid points . 
ms. marlene catterall : 
the hon. member also referred to the study on children . 
mr. chuck strahl ( fraser valley , canadian alliance ) : 
i would like to quickly go through that . 
none of that broad policy debate took place . 
i do not blame the courts . 
that is a shame . 
lawyers are going to have a *UNK* . 
however , it was strictly a public relations exercise . 
that is a serious error . 
that is a shame . 
the government is going to ask the courts to decide . 
that is a question we should ask today . 
it just came out of nowhere . 
what is going on ? 
the drunk driving bill is still lost in the black hole . 
why is that ? 
where are the priorities of government members coming from ? 
i do not understand . 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
i am not saying to try to promote that *UNK* . 
mr. chuck strahl : 
does it somehow strengthen the family ? 
what kind of a law is that ? 
that is wrong . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
i have four wonderful grandchildren . 
some hon. members : 
hear , hear . 
mr. ken epp : 
i am just kidding . 
an hon. member : 
it seems like much longer . 
mr. ken epp : 
yes , it seems like longer . 
i have talked about her in the house too . 
we have families who are literally struggling *UNK* . 
they cannot make ends meet . 
i would like to put that to rest . 
nothing could be further from the truth . 
it is about family . 
it is about friends . 
i reject outright their accusations . 
it is just the opposite . 
i reject that . 
there is nothing in this bill for them . 
does the government recognize their need for sharing their benefits ? 
that is what this bill is all about . 
that is interesting . 
that was before the amendment . 
the short title states : 
it goes on from there . 
the very first word is *UNK* ' ' . 
in fact , it is about marriage . 
it is about a relationship . 
that is what it is doing , in effect . 
absolutely not . 
ms. marlene catterall ( ottawa west-nepean , lib. ) : 
mr. ken epp : 
i remember often discussing this topic . 
that is not what *UNK* equality . 
there are many examples . 
one example is the case of the natives in this country . 
i might also add , *UNK* , even fat people . 
mr. chuck strahl ( fraser valley , canadian alliance ) : 
as always , he brings a personal touch to it . 
i do not claim any expertise . 
he mentioned relationships involving two sisters living together . 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , absolutely . 
i could think of hundreds of them . 
of course that was in *UNK* . 
they have very close friends . 
they live together , they share costs and expenses . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. mac harb ( ottawa centre , lib. ) : 
that is not always the case . 
we had a decision by a court . 
it was pierre *UNK* trudeau , my *UNK* . 
frankly , that is *UNK* the debate in the wrong direction . 
we must continue to focus on what is before us . 
the institution of marriage is not affected . 
our government has to reflect the needs of society . 
some of them felt terrible . 
we have to do what is right for them . 
mr. john bryden ( wentworth-burlington , lib. ) : 
it is true that this legislation is *UNK* . 
mr. mac harb : 
societies have changed . 
it is not my business at all . 
we need to get the facts straight . 
mr. andrew telegdi ( kitchener-waterloo , lib. ) : 
he made a very fine presentation to the house . 
mr. mac harb : 
mr. werner schmidt ( kelowna , canadian alliance ) : 
they are *UNK* . 
they are simple and should be *UNK* . 
they are asleep , and we should wake them . 
they are wise and we should listen to them . 
they know that they know . 
it has to do with marriage . 
we need clarity on this bill . 
why do we need it ? 
it is for our children that we send this message . 
i congratulate them for being here . 
are we a democratic institution or are not ? 
mr. john bryden : 
yes , yes . 
mr. werner schmidt : 
it matters what history has told us . 
that has been our history and tradition . 
she did none of those three . 
what was the amendment ? 
it would have meant something . 
she knows better . 
they want that in the law of canada . 
that is what they have told us . 
it is time that we determine what we are . 
are we democratic ? 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is the house ready for the question ? 
some hon. members : 
question . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
the question is on the amendment . 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the amendment ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
yea . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
ms. bev desjarlais ( churchill , ndp ) : 
the *UNK* parallel is very important to me . 
we recognize ourselves as being north of the *UNK* . 
this motion would certainly give us that opportunity . 
mr. peter adams ( peterborough , lib. ) : 
those great cities are located in *UNK* and russia . 
the arctic council has been very active . 
now of course it would include nunavut . 
i am pleased the hon. member is putting this motion forward . 
i commend him for it . 
mrs. francine lalonde ( mercier , bq ) : 
i move : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mrs. francine lalonde : 
yes , mr. speaker . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
fine . 
the amendment is therefore in order . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
i take that as a compliment . 
mr. ken epp : 
he is nodding yes . 
thank you . 
edmonton is at 53 degrees . 
we are indeed a hardy population in canada . 
it is a harsh climate . 
they are a hardy people . 
we ought to congratulate and admire them for that . 
a lot of people are not aware of that . 
there are many different forms of life . 
i have some serious questions on this subject . 
we see our prime minister going overseas . 
we have heard that in the last couple of days . 
now i have it on the record . 
mr. ted mcwhinney ( vancouver quadra , lib. ) : 
i note the comments of the minister of foreign affairs . 
i think the government could accept it . 
why not take advantage of that ? 
the hon. member for mercier is a very thoughtful member . 
he has reminded us that this is a *UNK* country . 
mr. mark muise ( west nova , pc ) : 
however , i would like to add a few more points . 
and what are the consequences of this change ? 
what is the purpose of it ? 
what are we trying to accomplish here ? 
for instance , what will happen to the provinces ? 
how will they react to this ? 
but are they in a position to respond to that impact ? 
mr. dennis gruending ( saskatoon-rosetown-biggar , ndp ) : 
i believe that is why this motion is important . 
he is saying that these people also have a concern . 
he is certainly talking about governments . 
he is saying that we have to change . 
i recommend to other members that they support it . 
i certainly agree with him . 
real progress is being made . 
let me be perfectly clear from the start . 
this funding helps keep the cost of food down . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
adjournment proceedings 
national defence 
mr. gordon earle ( halifax west , ndp ) : 
concrete , positive action is desperately needed in this case . 
iran 
mr. bill graham ( toronto centre-rosedale , lib. ) : 
these young people want changes . 
that was obviously indicated in the consequences of the recent elections . 
the president , mr. *UNK* , is a very positive individual . 
he wrote a book called *UNK* of *UNK* ' ' . 
we see a real change in attitude . 
we see arbitrary actions of authority . 
there is a parliamentary majority in favour of reform . 
the morality police are still *UNK* young people . 
what are we doing to encourage change ? 
how are we helping *UNK* who want change to get change ? 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

*UNK* so it seems

changing their name 
still makes them the same 
changing their leader 
won ' t help them much either . 
with *UNK* backing out , & long *UNK* in 
the battle within is about to begin . 
so it ' s east versus west 
to determine their best . 
and so we must wonder 
when we ' ll see their next *UNK*

more errors will come . 
so it ' s back to the west

mr. derek lee : 
the deputy speaker : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
budget implementation act , 2000 
budget 2000 is an historic budget . 
it is also the largest federal transfer . 
budget 2000 does exactly that . 
i am sure hon. colleagues will support this measure . 
let me explain the background to this change . 
contribution rates are increasing in a *UNK* manner . 
mr. monte solberg ( medicine hat , canadian alliance ) : 
he said some things that really need to be responded to . 
we have a crisis in health care . 
this is ridiculous . 
absolutely not . 
no . 
mr. roy cullen : 
what about tax points ? 
mr. monte solberg : 
i hear my hon. friend . 
that agreement was made 23 years ago . 
there were no strings attached . 
at what point does that money belong to the provinces ? 
absolutely not . 
i do not think that is dealing with the problem . 
it has completely abdicated its responsibility . 
not at all . 
does the budget deal with that problem ? 
let us go through the numbers . 
my friend talked about the child tax benefit . 
what is the definition of a tax break ? 
that is not a tax break . 
that is a social program . 
those are social programs . 
they are not tax cuts . 
we cannot call that a tax cut . 
what about bracket creep ? 
is that really a tax break ? 
we are happy the government has done it . 
that is exactly what it does . 
that is the real tax relief . 
that is not very much tax relief . 
i will get into that in more detail in a moment . 
it truly is a concern . 
it is a problem for a number of reasons . 
clearly canadian is now clearly not canadian . 
why is that ? 
there is a huge *UNK* to the united states . 
bill c-32 simply does not do that . 
in france it grew three times faster . 
the government should be ashamed of that . 
that should be a wake up call . 
we have an educated nation . 
we have a history of being innovative . 
we are entrepreneurs . 
these are our great natural advantages . 
they do some things well . 
i will *UNK* that . 
*UNK* words were never spoken . 
that is a *UNK* *UNK* . 
it stinks . 
what are those things ? 
we would put it into higher education . 
they want an educated *UNK* in the country . 
we support that . 
we could put it into health care . 
let us make those kinds of fundamental choices . 
let us *UNK* . 
that is the first thing we do . 
what would we do with that *UNK* billion ? 
it is their money . 
it is incredible . 
people work very hard . 
that is all they ask . 
they are not asking a lot . 
that is what happens too often today in canada . 
how do we do this ? 
the canadian alliance has a solution . 
we call it solution 17 . 
it has three major elements . 
it is not the only one . 
absolutely . 
absolutely . 
we want to keep them here . 
the top 10% produce around 50% . 
do we want to *UNK* those people and drive them out ? 
i do not think so . 
it encourages an environment where there is capital *UNK* . 
we understand that . 
i do not believe in the politics of envy . 
that is crazy . 
obviously it is . 
does it *UNK* people at the high end ? 
no it does not . 
in fact it will draw people back . 
ireland is an amazing success story . 
what did it do ? 
another thing ireland did was it bought some labour peace . 
it dropped corporate taxes dramatically . 
what was the impact ? 
its biggest export was people . 
when ireland figured that out , what happened ? 
it has a growth rate which is through the *UNK* . 
we could be the place where all the money *UNK* to . 
it boggles the mind . 
that is so wrong . 
well , thanks very little . 
i am not interested in that . 
those are the types of public policy decisions we should make . 
solution 17 is part of that . 
i have talked a bit about solution 17 . 
we should pay down that debt more *UNK* . 
some revenues are starting to come in . 
let us make *UNK* while the sun *UNK* . 
mr. eric lowther : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
it is hardly a point of order . 
nevertheless we will put the question to the house . 
is there unanimous consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
mr. monte solberg : 
let us hope we have an election before then . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
some wondered *UNK* will the government strike a balance ? 
will there be tax reductions ? 
will the debt be lowered ? 
will social transfers finally be *UNK* ' ' 
this is a huge amount . 
this amount is both inadequate and a one time measure . 
the $2.5 billion announced for the provinces is far from enough . 
there has been a lot of talk of clarity this spring . 
we will have to wait . 
we have to know where the responsibility lies . 
it is almost incredible . 
where has the money gone ? 
were jobs created ? 
if so , where ? 
was there political patronage ? 
where has the money gone ? 
were jobs created ? 
was there political patronage ? 
no answers . 
the following comments are from the report : 
i will come back to immigration in greater detail . 
spending is still a concern . 
he is *UNK* an alarm . 
the report also reads as follows : 
what does *UNK* the rules mean ? 
the report goes on : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
i am sorry to interrupt the member . 
the hon. government house leader . 
hon. don boudria : 
routine proceedings 
committees of the house 
national defence and veterans affairs 
i also thank the hon. member for louis-hébert for her indulgence . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
government orders 
budget implementation act , 2000 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
one paper noted the following : 
this is almost unbelievable in the year 2000 . 
i cannot get over it . 
their letter reads in part : 
the letter goes on to say : 
we do not test these products ourselves . 
you asked whether we are prepared . 
i have been advocating this for a long time . 
there is cause for concern . 
the same is true here . 
here , they have not even been defined . 
what are we to make of this ? 
the department ' s budget is also getting smaller . 
the liberal government is not *UNK* its spending . 
these are ad hoc measures . 
they are not long term measures . 
i have tried to *UNK* a clear picture . 
i would like the government to remember the important points . 
*UNK* bothers me just as much . 
it will probably be more than that . 
we have to work with the numbers we have . 
that is not the right priority . 
that is not the case . 
therefore that is a dangerous precedent to set . 
after the *UNK* it started to pull back , to withdraw . 
that should be our number one priority . 
knowledge is extremely important in terms of building a strong economy . 
the government across the way is the real conservative party . 
we need a public system of health care . 
we need real progressive change . 
we need some social democracy . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
i would like to simply *UNK* 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
hon. lorne nystrom : 
i assume he was referring to health care . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
private members ' business 
witness protection program act 
mr. jay hill ( prince george-peace river , canadian alliance ) : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
does the hon. member have unanimous consent of the house ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
mr. jim abbott ( kootenay-columbia , canadian alliance ) : 
these are all worthy goals and objectives . 
mrs. marlene jennings ( notre-dame-de-grâce-lachine , lib. ) : 
it definitely has my support . 
let us look at some of them . 
however , we have recently made some progress in this area . 
that is a move forward . 
historically , family violence has been hidden in silence and denial . 
the reasons for this are clear . 
this brings me back to the issue of bill c-223 . 
it is *UNK* used in matters of organized crime . 
we should allow for the possibility of a *UNK* of options . 
spousal abuse is a serious issue . 
mr. gordon earle ( halifax west , ndp ) : 
domestic violence and spousal abuse is a very serious problem . 
she was around 15 years old at that time . 
her father had an alcohol problem . 
it was a very sad situation . 
accountability is very important . 
bill c-223 would improve upon that situation . 
mrs. diane ablonczy ( calgary-nose hill , canadian alliance ) : 
this bill would do that . 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
this is a very worthy and worthwhile endeavour . 
there are many safe houses set up across the country . 
it would *UNK* the mandate . 
other members have alluded to it . 
there are programs that promote this type of protection . 
it very much *UNK* the interests of justice . 
it is a very sound , common sense initiative . 
it is necessary . 
the progressive conservative party of canada wholeheartedly supports this initiative . 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
then there is the denial and then there is the *UNK* . 
the *UNK* increases . 
here are some of the more common responses . 
they hope that the relationship will get better . 
they do not want to break up the family . 
she fears for her own and her children ' s safety . 
she depends on her partner ' s income . 
she has nowhere to go . 
that is very significant . 
both of them need help . 
i thank the member for bringing forward the bill . 
i believe he has some support . 
i am sure we can work out how to do this . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. jay hill ( prince george-peace river , canadian alliance ) : 
i would suggest just the opposite . 
it does not just affect adults . 
the deputy speaker : 
order , please . 
adjournment proceedings 
veterans affairs 
mr. gordon earle ( halifax west , ndp ) : 
perhaps i should not have been surprised . 
the issue remains on the table . 
delighted indeed . 
i ask the liberal government to respond now to this issue . 
let us talk about this issue . 
the deputy speaker : 
i am afraid the hon. member has run out of time . 
health 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
i found this really fascinating . 
there appear to be *UNK* . 
the deputy speaker :

questions on the order paper 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
budget implementation act , 2000 
mr. jim jones ( markham , pc ) : 
the 2000 budget was the tax cutting budget . 
that surplus ought to be returned to the canadian taxpayers . 
that is a surplus of $6 billion . 
it does not seem like a fair system . 
mr. greg thompson ( new brunswick southwest , pc ) : 
mr. jim jones : 
cancer patients are going to the u.s. for treatment . 
mr. garry breitkreuz ( yorkton-melville , canadian alliance ) : 
we are also proposing a *UNK* deduction for each child . 
i wonder if the hon. member has some reaction to that . 
we feel that it would support the family and children . 
mr. jim jones : 
the family is the future of canada . 
mr. greg thompson ( new brunswick southwest , pc ) : 
i *UNK* the words of my colleague from markham . 
what happened to that budget ? 
we have basically killed ourselves with the debt load . 
that did not happen . 
that did not happen . 
that is *UNK* . 
we know they have to be paid . 
again this is arithmetic that a grade school student could understand . 
we have to get the economy moving . 
let us look at some of its successes . 
let us look at the deficit and why it was reduced . 
the government had no choice . 
it had to act and it did act . 
mr. howard hilstrom ( selkirk-interlake , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. greg thompson : 
we are barely getting out of that . 
the member is absolutely right about the *UNK* . 
talk about *UNK* . 
canadians want health care . 
there is more the government can do . 
why ? 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
*UNK* , that is very discouraging . 
the rest of it is taken from us . 
they do not do what is good for children . 
the government has no money . 
the degree to which this government does it is excessive . 
the government ' s *UNK* agenda continues . 
yet the facts *UNK* the situation . 
it is a fairly big document . 
it has about 350 pages in it . 
we see in 1998-99 it was *UNK* billion . 
what is the number ? 
it is *UNK* billion . 
we have young pages in this place . 
yes , i always voted . 
did that happen ? 
it surely did not . 
the numbers are obvious . 
they *UNK* it did not exist . 
they did not address it . 
it is atrocious . 
the tax revenues are up . 
it is right in the budget document . 
the auditor general is a non-partisan officer of the house . 
have the liberals corrected it according to the actuarial standards ? 
no , they have not . 
they have made some little *UNK* changes . 
i have *UNK* the secret . 
the *UNK* has been blown off that one . 
we have seen all of that . 
the government is not responsible . 
we have a hardworking *UNK* population . 
it should be debt free . 
mr. antoine dubé ( lévis-et-chutes-de-la-chaudière , bq ) : 
not that i support it . 
that is what quebec wants to do . 
that would be the *UNK* . 
this is not consistent . 
and there is another thing . 
to what end ? 
it is completely ridiculous . 
but the government went ahead anyway . 
in 1993 , a leaders ' debate was held . 
nothing is changed . 
it is paid out based on need . 
what is the advantage ? 
tax points are the same thing . 
the other provinces do not . 
it is not constructive spending . 
the federal system serves them well . 
this has to be said . 
i am greatly concerned about shipbuilding . 
exports are often mentioned . 
the government talks about globalization and the internet . 
they should talk to their member of parliament . 
they are entitled to objective information . 
they must see it for themselves . 
it ignores provincial jurisdiction . 
that is the main thing wrong with it . 
mrs. francine lalonde ( mercier , bq ) : 
mr. antoine dubé : 
shipping and shipbuilding are not exempt . 
mr. bob mills ( red deer , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. antoine dubé : 
mr. speaker , i thank the hon. member for his question . 
mr. gordon earle ( halifax west , ndp ) : 
it should never be seen as just being about money . 
it sets a sense of direction . 
it is a very important topic . 
usually a budget attempts to be good news . 
i will read a few quotes which come directly from them . 
many people across this country need their *UNK* . 
the cost of gasoline is too high . 
thank you ' ' . 
people are concerned about what is happening . 
they are very pleased when we communicate with them . 
why are these hospitals in debt ? 
why is our health care system suffering ? 
when they *UNK* their *UNK* , we jump . 
look at what has happened . 
everybody else will wait in line . 
health care in our country is a very serious issue . 
nothing . 
it was *UNK* up to look good ' ' . 
they have been around for quite some time . 
this is not what people want . 
people see through this . 
cape breton is a wonderful part of our province . 
it has all kinds of potential . 
people see through that . 
we can do that . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. gordon earle : 
no , mr. speaker . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. gordon earle : 
we need the infrastructure now . 
we need these programs to move in favour of the communities . 
we want to watch that infrastructure very closely . 
the health care system is a mess . 
i have spoken about this already . 
we know that this must be more than window dressing . 
these are very important issues . 
in some cases , constituents never see their elected representatives . 
we have to make the government listen . 
there is not much left over . 
this issue was sadly lacking in the budget . 
what happened to the debt ? 
is the government not worried about it ? 
that is a very important comment . 
what will we be leaving our children ? 
what will our legacy be to our children ? 
unfortunately , we see the government moving in an opposite direction . 
what kind of system are we leaving to our children ? 
i think that is a good one . 
mr. ken epp : 
was it the minister of finance ? 
mr. gordon earle : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
so feel free . 
the hon. member for halifax west . 
mr. gordon earle : 
however , the key is this . 
these are the kinds of comments that are coming forward . 
of course it is important . 
mr. dale johnston ( wetaskiwin , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. gordon earle : 
mr. gary lunn ( saanich-gulf islands , canadian alliance ) : 
canadians are getting less . 
we have seen our disposable income continually fall . 
we have become worse off . 
this all comes back to the minister of finance . 
time and again we see that there is no accountability . 
these programs create a life of their own . 
unfortunately , that is not happening . 
i will give an example from my riding . 
one of those institutions is about to be closed . 
there is not enough money . 
the pie is not big enough . 
it is wrong . 
health care in this country is in a crisis . 
let us call a *UNK* a *UNK* . 
it is absolutely amazing . 
it is beyond *UNK* . 
we have to put a solution on the table . 
it did not help them . 
all the money was for *UNK* . 
they were extremely frustrated five years later . 
people are dying while on waiting lists . 
let us look at the billion dollar *UNK* . 
the budget was tabled in the house in february . 
how did the government respond ? 
it received $1 billion . 
our national health care is very sacred . 
the canadian alliance has a better plan . 
some hon. members : 
that is not in the plan . 
mr. gary lunn : 
guess what happens at the end of this year ? 
it goes back to below zero . 
that is is so wrong . 
the government is not interested in anything like that . 
it is none other than the minister of finance . 
children ' s lives will be put at risk . 
people will die . 
mr. hec clouthier : 
that is the province . 
mr. gary lunn : 
no , that is factual . 
it will be very tragic . 
they will have to be *UNK* to vancouver . 
it is wrong . 
it is time that the government did something about it . 
the savings of canadians have dropped . 
young families are struggling . 
health care is in an absolute , complete crisis . 
it is a disgrace . 
what is the government ' s six point plan ? 
that is wrong . 
in my riding *UNK* were the big issue . 
it is long overdue . 
mr. philip mayfield ( cariboo-chilcotin , canadian alliance ) : 
how would my colleague rectify this situation ? 
mr. gary lunn : 
however , where is the *UNK* billion increase in spending going ? 
some of the grants are absolutely *UNK* . 
they are almost insulting to repeat . 
they are absolutely horrific . 
it *UNK* those types of programs . 
the member made a very important point . 
there was an *UNK* billion spending increase . 
our national health care needs to become stronger . 
people with lower incomes would be the biggest beneficiaries . 
that is wrong . 
where does the money go ? 
that is so frustrating to me . 
there is example after example . 
there are lots of examples . 
it is corrupt and it is wrong . 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. gary lunn : 
we have seen the farm crisis . 
we are going to have stated objectives . 
that money will reach the people . 
these programs are delivered *UNK* and *UNK* . 
that goes to the core of the problem of the government . 
they are not going to stop until they do . 
mr. rick borotsik ( brandon-souris , pc ) : 
unfortunately the budget does not speak to that . 
the government does not believe canadians are capable of doing that . 
i will speak to that in certain areas . 
it is called vision . 
it is true . 
however we live in a new and innovative society . 
the government does not recognize that . 
it has no vision . 
we have talked about that . 
there is no vision . 
let us talk about the lack of vision in health care . 
two things are wrong with that . 
let us talk about bill c-32 specifically . 
i mentioned the lack of vision . 
let us talk about chst . 
that has been reduced . 
mr. hec clouthier : 
that is wrong and the member knows it . 
mr. rick borotsik : 
mr. speaker , they like to dispute that . 
there are three issues in health care . 
the first is that we have an aging population . 
i have talked about the new global economy . 
we live in a *UNK* world . 
there is also technology and inflation . 
we will not get any of those with this government . 
bill c-32 also deals with employment insurance . 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
the member referred to it as the basic personal deduction . 
now we are up to *UNK* billion . 
my question is simple . 
mr. rick borotsik : 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
the deputy speaker : 
order , please . 
an hon. member : 
we do not want to hear him . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. rick borotsik : 
the money should be given back to them . 
those dollars should be invested back into the pockets of canadians . 
mr. bill casey ( cumberland-colchester , pc ) : 
it is inconsistency and it is *UNK* . 
all he had to do was to ask me . 
education was second . 
it is hard to get nursing care . 
it is hard to get into hospital . 
it is hard to get a hospital bed . 
that is one hospital . 
it is truly a *UNK* . 
what does the government come up with ? 
for this situation to be allowed to continue is *UNK* of . 
certainly , it is totally inconsistent . 
why were these toll highways built ? 
they are going to stay the same . 
i mentioned *UNK* in my opening remarks . 
i see much of this budget as *UNK* . 
he has spent years *UNK* a plan for via rail . 
what did he do ? 
there is nothing new . 
there is nothing additional . 
it would not work and we all know it . 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
our highway system is deplorable . 
i would like to make this point to my hon. colleague . 
mr. bill casey : 
the fact of the matter is it is a national disgrace . 
there is actually a highway deficit in this country . 
we owe money to our national highway system . 
mr. roy bailey : 
i was being generous . 
mr. bill casey : 
nova scotia gets zip . 
mr. john williams ( st. albert , canadian alliance ) : 
i want to point out a couple of things . 
the *UNK* gst goes to the federal government . 
it is worth thinking about . 
it is the exact same amount of tax . 
it bothers me *UNK* . 
an hon. member : 
that is a good point . 
mr. john williams : 
it is an excellent point , as my colleague says . 
the report covers a number of horrifying things . 
in paragraph *UNK* the auditor general writes : 
this is the year 2000 . 
that was eight years ago . 
the agreement had expired . 
no one had really *UNK* to do anything about it . 
they just wrote the cheques and carried on . 
what about things such as special needs ? 
we are concerned about special needs . 
the department does not know . 
i have a problem with these kinds of numbers . 
we know what happens with the minister of hrdc . 
native people cannot do that . 
only 30% succeed in meeting the basic fundamental requirements . 
agreements *UNK* and he does not follow up on them . 
the department is a disgrace . 
he has no *UNK* . 
where is the logic ? 
the minister kept the study under *UNK* . 
i cannot understand it . 
how bad is it ? 
let us take one particular claim as an example . 
it was a complex claim . 
why ? 
there are *UNK* to approve . 
when are they going to finish ? 
they spent 10,000 hours on one claim . 
they had to get some scientific expert advice . 
we are not sure how many *UNK* there were . 
let us look at the rationale . 
the *UNK* did the research and development . 
he got it again . 
the rules allowed him to get it again . 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
what will we do ? 
one word can sum up the last 20 years : nothing . 
nothing has changed and it is getting worse . 
mr. john williams : 
the goal is to provide educated children on reserves . 
mr. roy bailey : 
f *UNK* . 
the department ' s mind is in a *UNK* . 
mr. deepak obhrai ( calgary east , canadian alliance ) : 
this is my second speech on the budget . 
my remarks are based on two concepts . 
people are having a hard time making ends meet . 
but a lot of our money *UNK* into the government *UNK* . 
it is interesting the way the whole taxation system is designed . 
in between what are they supposed to do ? 
how are they supposed to live ? 
i am paying so much in taxes ' ' . 
there is nothing to ask . 
we have people in the government who have their own *UNK* . 
that is great . 
i applaud him for that . 
i hope it goes higher and higher . 
i commend them . 
i have seen them hard at work . 
somewhere down the line it will crack . 
they must be able to take advantage of market opportunities . 
they are the ones who are out there selling their products . 
everyone knows that . 
i do not have to repeat it . 
everyone talks about it . 
that is a great idea . 
it is fantastic if we can do it . 
canadians are worried . 
today ' s polls indicate the priorities of canadians . 
why should it not be ? 
this is a government run by polls . 
everything it does is by polls . 
i am sure it will . 
that is what canadians should do . 
let us talk about health care for a moment . 
we listen to the *UNK* statements of the minister of health . 
we have heard from businesses . 
i find them rather interesting . 
why ? 
can they not stand positive news ? 
mr. deepak obhrai : 
i will tell him why . 
instead it has set us back . 
it is just flying straight . 
nothing great has come out of this . 
there is nothing to be very excited about there . 
it will not last too long . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mrs. diane ablonczy ( calgary-nose hill , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. deepak obhrai : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
absolutely not , mr. speaker . 
mr. deepak obhrai : 
the government has the wrong priorities . 
we need officers on the street . 
mr. rick laliberte ( churchill river , ndp ) : 
canada is a vast country . 
we must *UNK* them . 
this requires strategic financial investments . 
none has been announced . 
the program is called *UNK* . 
more people want to have access to these community projects . 
the speaker : 
the member still has 14 minutes left in his talk .

all of that will also be *UNK* in due course . 
mr. gary lunn ( saanich-gulf islands , canadian alliance ) : 
that is not *UNK* . 
what is it trying to hide ? 
it is very selective about what it *UNK* . 
to wait six years for two pages is not *UNK* . 
we want the board meeting minutes . 
why will the government not release them ? 
he should see the ethics counsellor . 
that is the long answer .

government orders 
budget implementation act , 2000 
mr. rick laliberte ( churchill river , ndp ) : 
national parks have been a great part of our summer activities . 
we are going very slowly . 
there was nothing from the government . 
there has been zero increase in their budgets . 
the issue of northern development in canada is of great interest . 
the north has a *UNK* population . 
one of them deals with the issue of banking . 
that is the investment banking side . 
sustainable development is the key . 
let me speak about investment banking . 
that is what we call *UNK* . 
let us hold on tight to our resources . 
the resources in canada and the world are *UNK* . 
the *UNK* ratio might diminish to *UNK* . 
we must continue to support rural and *UNK* communities . 
this is the reality of being canadian . 
we are a huge country . 
that is a challenge for the government . 
we have no alternatives . 
the *UNK* that were there before are not there today . 
mr. garry breitkreuz ( yorkton-melville , canadian alliance ) : 
is this fair ? 
mr. rick laliberte : 
this whole place is built on politics . 
we have a party *UNK* of the west . 
politics is politics . 
mr. john duncan ( vancouver island north , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. rick laliberte : 
some of its aspirations were cost recovery . 
we have to consider the social conscience of the country . 
i am talking about program and service *UNK* . 
it is nice that the hon. member has raised this issue . 
there are highways needed in western canada . 
these are the sad facts and sad results . 
mr. bob mills ( red deer , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. rick laliberte : 
we would see a better economic cycle within the regions . 
people talk about the fear of globalization . 
mr. howard hilstrom : 
that is not true . 
the north west company runs all that . 
mr. rick laliberte : 
*UNK* and globalization are in a similar realm . 
mr. bob mills ( red deer , canadian alliance ) : 
let us talk about some of the failures of that budget . 
there is program spending . 
certainly liberals love program spending . 
bureaucracy leads to *UNK* . 
*UNK* lead to ways to *UNK* friends . 
what about that debt ? 
what about that *UNK* billion ? 
by 1972 we had *UNK* billion in debt . 
but that same government carried on . 
let us look at where that places us . 
how does the budget deal with that ? 
let us figure out the mathematics of that one . 
this budget did not even address that . 
is that acceptable ? 
that is the first failure , mr. speaker . 
what about those grants ? 
we have heard much in the house about the *UNK* . 
how about the *UNK* museum ? 
that is a sorry *UNK* in a democracy . 
the letter was from the deputy prime minister . 
that is not 100% funding coming from the federal government . 
that is the kind of stuff that happens with these grants . 
let us talk about health care . 
how did this budget deal with health care ? 
how does it figure that ? 
where did that come from ? 
immediately upon doing that , the federal government raised its taxes . 
the money is really not there . 
let us talk about actual transfers of cash . 
what has the government done with that ? 
in 1995 they were *UNK* billion . 
in 1996 there were *UNK* billion . 
guess what ? 
what has happened in between besides inflation ? 
because of the lack of funding . 
who is to blame ? 
it is not just the provinces . 
there is certainly something wrong there . 
we are opposed to that . 
that is what they would like . 
this budget did not deliver that . 
that is just not good enough . 
how do we do it ? 
we have to do it by co-operation with the provinces . 
what do we do to the provinces ? 
what about taxes ? 
it was disappointing . 
we did nothing . 
we showed no interest in agriculture whatsoever in this budget . 
you have seen them , too , mr. speaker . 
what are we doing to our nato and *UNK* partners ? 
i was not happy with this budget . 
do you know what , mr. speaker ? 
that is exactly what they did . 
since 1977 the world has changed . 
surely that says something about the priorities of this government . 
those are just two . 
i could go on and on . 
mr. bob mills : 
from then on there is not a dollar left in there . 
there is $4 billion less in spending . 
we are losing half our *UNK* doctors . 
that is something to talk about . 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
he is quite right . 
he was *UNK* , very *UNK* . 
he is nodding his head . 
he is still nodding his head . 
mr. bob mills : 
it was first introduced in 1966 . 
how do we fix that plan ? 
what can we do about it ? 
i did an interesting project . 
i went door to door . 
they buy their cars from companies in which they have shares . 
they are proud of it . 
it is sustainable . 
the money is there in the country to invest . 
they do not have any foreign debt because of it . 
mr. paul szabo : 
you said scrap it . 
mr. bob mills : 
the member will not try anything new . 
he is not prepared to try anything new . 
some members across have their heads in the sand . 
we are the canadian alliance party . 
we believe in democracy . 
mr. jim pankiw ( saskatoon-humboldt , canadian alliance ) : 
it might have been the house leader . 
we have a $600 billion national debt . 
the government refuses to act . 
i will illustrate a few examples . 
mr. paul szabo : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. jim pankiw : 
mr. speaker , i would like to clarify that . 
that is what i meant . 
one area of concern has to do with employment insurance premiums . 
all of that money comes from property taxes . 
an hon. member : 
it was *UNK* million . 
mr. jim pankiw : 
the senate is another example of waste and patronage . 
the deputy speaker : 
i know he would not want to be . 
mr. jim pankiw : 
thank you , mr. speaker . 
i know the people of alberta feel the same way . 
liberal priorities are *UNK* . 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
i wrote a book called divorce : 
they are all available on *UNK* . 
that person was me . 
mr. maurice vellacott : 
the deputy speaker : 
it is questions and comments . 
mr. paul szabo : 
mr. jim pankiw : 
i believe that is somewhat hypocritical of him to say that . 
he talks a mean talk . 
i support family values . 
mr. paul szabo : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. jim pankiw : 
mr. rick laliberte ( churchill river , ndp ) : 
this budget highlights an increased budget for the rcmp . 
could the hon. member answer that ? 
mr. jim pankiw :

message from the senate 
the deputy speaker : 
royal assent 
the deputy speaker : 
order , please . 
rideau hall 
ottawa , 
april 13 , 2000 
mr. speaker , 
secretary to the governor general 
budget implementation act , 2000 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
mr. speaker , i apologize to the house . 
i was a little outrageous with my *UNK* about the family . 
i feel kind of strongly about the issue . 
i do respect the rule of law . 
there was some talk about our national debt . 
it is not the case . 
in fact the economy continues to grow . 
interest rates remain at relatively low levels . 
that was another $42 billion being added to the national debt . 
it is not just taxes . 
that is a very substantial decrease . 
we are very fortunate to have *UNK* growth in the economy . 
that is very important . 
canadians wanted the canada pension plan saved . 
they are living from paycheque to paycheque . 
that is a very important aspect . 
mrs. francine lalonde ( mercier , bq ) : 
this surplus is unhealthy because it is hidden . 
this is not good . 
i am referring to international development assistance . 
he had said that the level *UNK* was unacceptable . 
rich nations cannot be rich alone . 
mr. howard hilstrom ( selkirk-interlake , canadian alliance ) : 
the debt is sitting at around *UNK* billion . 
electoral reforms are required on some reserves . 
mr. paul crête ( kamouraska-rivière-du-loup-témiscouata-les basques , bq ) : 
this would rid the canadian system of its accountability problems . 
this would be great for to all canadians . 
there is no such thing in the current program . 
today , the results are there . 
there is evidence . 
the surtax has been eliminated . 
in both cases , it is trying to save face . 
mr. gurmant grewal ( surrey central , canadian alliance ) : 
these arguments can be easily *UNK* . 
what does it rely on ? 
it simply *UNK* on tax increases . 
we came up with a strong initiative , solution 17 . 
it is fair and it is simpler . 
the deputy speaker : 
private members ' business 
treaties act 
mrs. francine lalonde ( mercier , bq ) : 
( a ) whose implementation requires 
and continuing : 
*UNK* the transfer of jurisdiction to such institutions . 
the institutions in question are international institutions . 
that is why we will strongly support our colleague . 
we already know that other parties have expressed their support . 
mr. gurmant grewal ( surrey central , canadian alliance ) : 
i congratulate the member from the bloc quebecois for his efforts . 
the canadian alliance would go even further . 
treaties are like *UNK* . 
they are supposed to be forever . 
it is remarkable . 
we do not know . 
why does he not try this idea at home in canada ? 
what a shame . 
what a laugh . 
what a sham . 
when has this ever happened ? 
good . 
no . 
what is the rush ? 
why do we not follow the right procedures ? 
we know how it signed those treaties . 
the treaties are signed , *UNK* and delivered behind closed doors . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. greg thompson ( new brunswick southwest , pc ) : 
the key word is *UNK* ' ' . 
that obviously means the people of canada . 
the summary of the bill states : 
that means this house , the house of commons . 
( a ) whose implementation requires 
the other one is the international law of the sea . 
where does that leave us ? 
in a sense these are treaties . 
we are not sure . 
this is the place where it should happen . 
we look forward to the debate . 
mr. richard marceau ( charlesbourg , bq ) : 
under bill c-214 : 
the royal assent 
and being returned : 
the deputy speaker : 
private members ' business 
treaties act 
mr. richard marceau ( charlesbourg , bq ) : 
the government ' s leadership is not being challenged here . 
that is the way it is done throughout the world . 
mr. ian murray ( lanark-carleton , lib. ) : 
does it need to be *UNK* *UNK* as he is proposing ? 
i have trouble following the hon. member on this point . 
nothing could be further from the truth . 
we already have consultative mechanisms . 
we do not need to reinvent the wheel . 
why did it do this ? 
here again the hon. member is not inventing anything new . 
this bill does no such thing . 
no such provincial prerogative exists . 
it is done because it has to be done . 
our current practice meets these *UNK* . 
mr. stéphan tremblay ( lac-saint-jean , bq ) : 
i am very interested in issues of globalization . 
we parliamentarians were not in the picture . 
an international agreement was being negotiated behind closed doors . 
it should be discussed ' ' . 
this is what democracy is all about . 
it is about debating issues . 
the deputy speaker : 
adjournment proceedings 
human resources development 
mr. garry breitkreuz ( yorkton-melville , canadian alliance ) : 
this is hard to believe . 
that is almost a year . 
taxes kill jobs . 
the deputy speaker : 
( the house adjourned at *UNK* p.m. )

war crimes are defined as : 
all manner of *UNK* were *UNK* .

government orders 
crimes against humanity act 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
it is no *UNK* matter . 
as such , the bill applies *UNK* . 
the conservative party supports this idea . 
there is potential for prosecution . 
this is a good provision . 
obviously there is potential for further legislation . 
the progressive conservative party also *UNK* this principle . 
mr. maurice vellacott ( wanuskewin , canadian alliance ) : 
there were secret meetings off to the side . 
this situation is no different . 
the international criminal court will have power to investigate . 
obviously we do have concerns about some of that . 
we should not give up our sovereignty . 
the letter from judge *UNK* *UNK* states : 
this was , mr. *UNK* 
idea ! 
he asks whether : 
that gets to the *UNK* of it . 
he went on to say : 
then he goes on to say : 
in whatever international law happens to be out there . 
that was a new one to me . 
what is enforced *UNK* ? 
i think this is a beautiful and wonderful thing . 
such tribunals would not be permanent . 
in effect we are signing a blank cheque . 
mr. maurice vellacott : 
mr. pat martin ( winnipeg centre , ndp ) : 
they were not adequate during kosovo . 
we *UNK* our way through the balkans . 
mr. maurice vellacott : 
we talk in terms of *UNK* that are *UNK* . 
what exactly do we mean by that ? 
we have no way of *UNK* those people . 
mr. grant hill ( macleod , canadian alliance ) : 
it is designed to be *UNK* to national criminal jurisdictions . 
the *UNK* of that future are *UNK* . 
to my mind that would be appropriate . 
national sovereignty is a concern . 
i am not certain that i have the answer to that . 
the second big issue for me is accountability . 
in my reading of this issue that is another question mark . 
i will use the specific example of expansion . 
no one would argue with that . 
how would i prevent those definitions expanding ? 
i mentioned briefly the issue of globalization . 
the bill may end up being *UNK* . 
mr. grant hill : 
madam speaker , i value the opinion of the member opposite . 
i do not think my concerns are *UNK* . 
mr. maurice vellacott ( wanuskewin , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. grant hill : 
let us not go down the road of *UNK* . 
mr. howard hilstrom ( selkirk-interlake , canadian alliance ) : 
that is a serious consideration . 
many countries in this world are still run by *UNK* .

petitions 
mr. randy white ( langley-abbotsford , canadian alliance ) moved : 
*UNK* and *UNK* : 
i just submitted three petitions today . 
that will fall on deaf ears . 
virtually everybody in the house has submitted petitions . 
that is the end of the deal . 
what was i proposing in the motion ? 
it is as simple as that . 
this is not happening today . 
it is not a good process whatsoever . 
that is what a petition really is . 
it is a citizens initiative to *UNK* change . 
mr. john duncan : 
when it reaches a certain *UNK* . 
mr. randy white : 
yes , i agree with my colleague . 
it makes sense to most people . 
hon. david m. collenette : 
you ' re cynical . 
mr. randy white : 
the minister says i am cynical . 
that is it . 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
there are a number of things that need to be done . 
in a representative democracy this is a very important issue . 
what is the magic of a *UNK* *UNK* ? 
it is an arbitrary figure . 
my concern is with who would use this provision . 
i have a number of concerns . 
one was the free trade agreement . 
*UNK* is the natural enemy of representative democracy . 
i could go on an on about this motion . 
it clearly will not work . 
this is still true today . 
mr. stéphane bergeron ( verchères-les-patriotes , bq ) : 
so petitions made this possible . 
and then nothing further is done . 
what did this deep desire for change *UNK* into ? 
nothing . 
the federal government has done absolutely nothing . 
points 3 and 4 *UNK* that : 
even the house is paying no attention to this motion . 
we are open to discussion . 
mr. john bryden ( wentworth-burlington , lib. ) : 
i remember *UNK* the words . 
so the member for langley-abbotsford i think touches a real nerve . 
they still have to have a voice in this place . 
i think that parliament is in the process of being reformed . 
mr. randy white ( langley-abbotsford , canadian alliance ) : 
that should be quite irrelevant . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
( the house adjourned at *UNK* p.m. )

house of commons 
monday , may 1 , 2000 
the house met at 11 a.m . 
prayers 
private members ' business 
cultural industry 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
mr. nelson riis : 
they feel proud of what we have accomplished . 
his name is mike *UNK* . 
his *UNK* is entitled *UNK* and *UNK* . 
i ' ve *UNK* to your cities , 
now i ' m just a country *UNK* , 
not *UNK* to *UNK* *UNK* . 
my *UNK* is atrocious , 
my *UNK* ' s even *UNK* ! 
but my *UNK* are plain an ' honest , 
like the children of the soil , 
the *UNK* , *UNK* and farmers 
whose work is honest *UNK* . 
the urban *UNK* don ' t like my *UNK* 
they will pick at every line 
my *UNK* ain ' t read in *UNK* *UNK* , 
where they *UNK* *UNK* and *UNK* , 
and i sure ain ' t rich or famous , 
but that just suits me fine , 
*UNK* you don ' t need fame or *UNK* 
to smell the *UNK* and *UNK* . 
basically , the cultural industry would *UNK* . 
ms. wendy lill ( dartmouth , ndp ) : 
they are driven to express themselves . 
they do all these things year in and year out . 
it is defined by our *UNK* . 
this is clearly illogical . 
i strongly support the important motion put forward by my colleague . 
i believe the intent behind the motion is very *UNK* . 
mr. inky mark ( dauphin-swan river , canadian alliance ) : 
tax relief should be broad based and not be targeted . 
all taxpayers will pay less . 
it would also reduce taxes on employment . 
tax savings would be *UNK* billion . 
this would also eliminate discrimination against a new economy . 
the tax savings would be *UNK* billion . 
there is no doubt we are in debt . 
canadians certainly deserve it at this time . 
mr. gilles-a . 
motion no. 259 reads as follows : 
i would like to give you a few examples . 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
these types of success stories are worthy of recognition . 
that is one way this could be addressed . 
mr. peter stoffer ( sackville-musquodoboit valley-eastern shore , ndp ) : 
his party proposes to get rid of the cbc . 
the next *UNK* net income is also partly *UNK* . 
he was a *UNK* *UNK* . 
he *UNK* literally . 
it is absolutely *UNK* . 
it is absolutely *UNK* . 
they do not do it for profit . 
this is the type of *UNK* that needs to grow . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
government orders 
immigration and refugee protection act 
these changes are important ones for a very simple reason . 
it is about respect . 
we celebrate diversity . 
we want to take advantage of those opportunities . 
they represent many of the core values that we share . 
i am working very closely with those provinces . 
this is an important piece of legislation . 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
does the act deliver ? 
those are good *UNK* which the minister has expressed . 
that has to be encouraging , but will the act deliver ? 
that is the question . 
that is the bottom line . 
i will talk about that today as well . 
the immigration act is made up of three separate *UNK* . 
in the economic *UNK* there are several different categories . 
that is the first *UNK* . 
canadians welcome genuine refugees . 
i will get into that as i go along . 
those are the three *UNK* . 
there has been a lot of talk about that *UNK* . 
it also talks about other technical matters . 
what is an immigration system about ? 
that is important . 
how were immigrants chosen and what process took place ? 
our system has failed us in that regard . 
unfortunately , the changes have not worked very well . 
how much deals with that in bill *UNK* ? 
would it be a third of the act ? 
the rest is left to regulation . 
that is completely unacceptable . 
there are some changes which are clearly negative . 
too much is left to regulation . 
*UNK* have been returned to our system . 
they may never come back . 
that is not the intent . 
immigration in canada should benefit canada . 
i believe that is a concern . 
it has been demonstrated that it will not work . 
it would cause the same kind of problem . 
those are some of the *UNK* . 
the regulations are very important . 
that is the way it has been interpreted . 
it is absurd . 
this bill will not help those people . 
will the bill help genuine refugees ? 
no , it will not . 
does that not make sense ? 
the united nations has a body that is quite capable . 
i have concerns in many areas . 
it does not work for genuine refugees . 
will the bill help to *UNK* families ? 
mr. bernard bigras ( rosemont , bq ) : 
bill *UNK* was introduced on april 6 , 2000 . 
*UNK* parties shall ensure that : 
the debate is primarily on clauses 50 to 55 . 
these three reasons are already included in the current act . 
instead , it ought to be *UNK* in the law . 
i have two comments to make in this regard . 
at times , perhaps often , the ruling was negative . 
this is the present state of affairs under the current legislation . 
they will now be ruled *UNK* if the *UNK* : 
in this regard , i wish to make a comment . 
this goes without saying . 
it is thus encouraging division . 
mr. bill blaikie ( winnipeg-transcona , ndp ) : 
both he and i will be speaking to the bill . 
we do not know what those regulations will be . 
that is certainly something i think all canadians would support . 
i would certainly urge that . 
mr. john solomon ( regina-lumsden-lake centre , ndp ) : 
immigration is very important . 
my *UNK* grandfather came to this country in *UNK* from ukraine . 
as an aside , my uncle still owns the property . 
i am worried that there will not be resources . 
saskatchewan is a *UNK* province in the centre of our country . 
the family *UNK* challenge has always been complex . 
the bill has many parts .

questions on the order paper 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
immigration and refugee protection act 
mr. john solomon ( regina-lumsden-lake centre , ndp ) : 
we cannot talk to people there . 
we only get a recorded message . 
mr. david price ( compton-stanstead , pc ) : 
figures do not lie . 
that is hardly a surprise . 
we are familiar with the immigration system . 
allow me to expand on these serious issues . 
what medical risks are *UNK* to canadians ? 
what new diseases are *UNK* *UNK* to canada ? 
what diseases will excessively burden the health care system ? 
this new funding will be *UNK* up very quickly . 
foreign police records may not be updated or reliable . 
that is not all . 
what kinds of people are *UNK* coming to this country ? 
where are these people going ? 
how many criminals are passing through ? 
as a party we are concerned about these potential criminals . 
this resolution passed *UNK* at committee . 
this does not *UNK* . 
that is strange since it is beneficial to both countries . 
we do not need to start *UNK* it . 
would the minister please clarify a representative ? 
why these numbers ? 
what does she mean by serious criminality ? 
i am not comfortable with these numbers . 
he spoke both of canada ' s official languages . 
this is being looked at . 
in my riding i have seven border *UNK* . 
however , that is one border *UNK* . 
they will just pick another border *UNK* . 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
that is a good point . 
it is not what it says it is . 
that is the way they allowed high numbers to come in . 
they were in office three years after that . 
mr. david price : 
i do agree with the hon. member on that . 
ms. raymonde folco ( laval west , lib. ) : 
mr. david price : 
we responded to these problems . 
the liberal government talks about 300,000 people . 
this is an *UNK* number . 
i do not think so . 
the last study was done in 1980 . 
there has been nothing since then . 
mr. rick borotsik ( brandon-souris , pc ) : 
mr. david price : 
it becomes a budget problem . 
equipment is available in most of the places but not everywhere . 
the problem is dollars . 
ms. raymonde folco ( laval west , lib. ) : 
we have to *UNK* the way we do things . 
we are not talking about tinkering . 
this bill *UNK* our doors *UNK* . 
the time has come to pass new legislation . 
this is framework legislation . 
even so , not everything can or should be in regulations . 
the framework legislation is based on those principles . 
the bill would guarantee fundamental rights . 
it clearly defines the power of arrest . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
was the member for laval west splitting her time ? 
ms. raymonde folco : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
it must have . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
i am wondering how she *UNK* this working . 
how is that going to work ? 
ms. raymonde folco : 
mr. reed elley ( nanaimo-cowichan , canadian alliance ) : 
ms. raymonde folco : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
i would like the member to answer that question . 
i have a second question which is on safe third countries . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
i am sorry . 
ms. raymonde folco : 
mr. jerry pickard ( chatham-kent essex , lib. ) : 
this will result in faster processing times . 
new funds have been designated to clear up *UNK* . 
i request everyone in the house to give it support . 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
the administration is the problem . 
the administration is separate from the act . 
mr. jerry pickard : 
mr. gurmant grewal ( surrey central , canadian alliance ) : 
they have given selective information to the media . 
people are making decisions based on government propaganda . 
therefore , the families could not be *UNK* . 
the people involved cannot work properly . 
he could not buy that *UNK* . 
this is unacceptable . 
we must not let it *UNK* further . 
that looks good on the surface . 
it is *UNK* . 
they do not care . 
she failed to *UNK* our legislation here in this country . 
that was her job to do . 
how can security checks be done ? 
we see canada as a land built by immigrants . 
we will continue to welcome new immigrants . 
we would support sponsorship for immediate family members . 
we would severely penalize those who *UNK* abuses of our system . 
we are proud of that . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
would the hon. member comment on that ? 
mr. gurmant grewal : 
i will blame the government to some extent . 
in a way they are to be *UNK* . 
let me give an example . 
this is *UNK* discrimination by the government . 
we should hire people based on merit . 
those things should not be a subject of the 21st century . 
mr. john mckay ( scarborough east , lib. ) : 
it is nice to work with a minister who listens . 
it was a fascinating trip . 
taiwan processes about *UNK* *UNK* a day . 
that is very interesting . 
we should all have these problems . 
other nations should have these problems . 
if they do not like that they disappear . 
these grounds are not new . 
in the majority of cases the decisions are unanimous . 
the committee listened to hours of testimony . 
she has picked up on that . 
again she has picked up on that . 
this has been a long process . 
mr. bernard bigras ( rosemont , bq ) : 
this bill makes changes in a number of areas . 
that is my first question . 
another issue concerns the detention of children . 
mr. john mckay : 
*UNK* of the process is a good idea . 
i remember a couple of cases in particular . 
he has been *UNK* as a physician for almost 20 years . 
he married and had a child . 
she was immediately denied . 
his mother did not want to *UNK* . 
she did not want to come here to live . 
she was very happy . 
this year he wanted to bring over his *UNK* . 
we had to go through the same *UNK* process . 
for years i have been talking with the ministers . 
it was denied . 
i happen to represent the university of manitoba . 
it was denied . 
it goes on and on . 
why ? 
it is not an easy issue . 
how do we do it ? 
they have worked on it very hard . 
i mentioned a committee . 
my colleague for winnipeg north-st . 
we all work together . 
we first went through the initial *UNK* . 
the initial concepts were put forward . 
we met with staff from the department . 
we want to share it . 
mr. daniel turp ( beauharnois-salaberry , bq ) : 
mr. bernard bigras ( rosemont , bq ) : 
why should we take that agreement further ? 
mr. daniel turp : 
mr. speaker , i thank my colleague for his question . 
canada had its share of constitutional debates . 
some people seem tired of it . 
our party does not believe this to be the case . 
mr. yves rocheleau ( trois-rivières , bq ) : 
i would like to hear my distinguished colleague on this . 
mr. daniel turp : 
mr. steve mahoney ( mississauga west , lib. ) : 
i was getting a little nervous . 
however , that of course did not happen . 
do they get the attention ? 
do they get the media ? 
let me be clear . 
this is a human tragedy . 
this is as a result of organized crime . 
they are not the criminals . 
what happens ? 
this is not an easy problem to resolve . 
we are dealing with language and cultural barriers . 
why are they here ? 
they *UNK* a couple of houses . 
we all remember them . 
they were called the boat people . 
that is what it is all about . 
where did it go ? 
the minister says we have to close the back door . 
it is an interesting idea . 
it is all about immigration . 
we recently dealt with the citizenship bill . 
they line up . 
i sat in on some of the *UNK* . 
not true . 
that was to *UNK* , *UNK* . 
it is a city of six million people . 
people would think they were in *UNK* or *UNK* . 
hon. elinor caplan : 
or mississauga . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
they live in danger all the time . 
it was amazing . 
ms. wendy lill ( dartmouth , ndp ) : 
would he be welcomed in this country ? 
mr. steve mahoney : 
the member made two points . 
i believe we will do that . 
mr. peter mancini ( sydney-victoria , ndp ) : 
this is a tremendously important issue . 
everyone in the house has spoken about their own heritage . 
my own heritage is *UNK* and *UNK* . 
he chose this country to build a life . 
it also defines whom we will not let in . 
it is a reflection of our international obligations . 
the act has been amended numerous times . 
that *UNK* is on both sides . 
we have those groups on one side . 
again let us be clear . 
i support that . 
i also have some other concerns . 
i know we will have an opportunity to examine them . 
he did not have a degree in computer science . 
he did not have financial backing . 
hon. elinor caplan : 
he was the best . 
mr. peter mancini : 
the minister says *UNK* was the best ' ' . 
my family would agree with that . 
i know that the minister will answer these questions . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
adjournment proceedings 
immigration 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
perhaps the minister could also confirm something . 
immigration 
mrs. rose-marie ur ( lambton-kent-middlesex , lib. ) : 
we should not be a haven for illegal immigrants . 
this is an international problem which requires international solutions . 
foreign affairs 
hon. charles caccia ( davenport , lib. ) : 
what has been canada ' s reaction so far ? 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) moved : 
the *UNK* came on the scene rapidly . 
it tells us not to worry . 
we should trust *UNK* . 
that has been the case from the outset . 
there is no doubt about it . 
so much for good intentions . 
is there any benefit to producers ? 
mr. reed elley ( nanaimo-cowichan , canadian alliance ) : 
there are *UNK* of material on this issue . 
ms. hélène alarie : 
the issue is a bit different . 
mr. dick proctor ( palliser , ndp ) : 
ms. hélène alarie : 
ms. hélène alarie : 
i must offer my colleague only partial *UNK* . 
ms. jocelyne girard-bujold ( jonquière , bq ) : 
i congratulate my colleague on her *UNK* and success . 
let us bear a few facts in mind . 
hundreds of countries believed in this vision . 
this might have disastrous effects . 
i move : 
the deputy speaker : 
the amendment is in order . 
the debate is now on the amendment . 
mr. peter adams ( peterborough , lib. ) : 
i think it is a concern we share . 
would that be the sort of criterion ? 
these matters are very important . 
ms. jocelyne girard-bujold : 
labelling must be mandatory . 
we must respect the consumer ' s freedom of choice . 
i would like to give an example . 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
i am *UNK* that he did so . 
i listened carefully to his speech . 
hon. lyle vanclief : 
it is not *UNK* . 
they can make that choice . 
they will have to make that decision . 
mr. rick casson ( lethbridge , canadian alliance ) : 
hon. lyle vanclief : 
mr. dick proctor ( palliser , ndp ) : 
i wonder if he could clarify it from his *UNK* . 
hon. lyle vanclief : 
that is the importance of the discussions around *UNK* *UNK* . 
we cannot and do not want to go there . 
mr. reed elley ( nanaimo-cowichan , canadian alliance ) : 
this is a truly global issue . 
i think every member in the house wants the same thing . 
the *UNK* effect of these things have been devastating . 
can genetically modified *UNK* solve those problems ? 
i frankly doubt it . 
can they solve some of the problems ? 
possibly . 
are there risks involved ? 
most certainly . 
i believe the bigger questions are : 
we all take risks every day . 
we are not unique in our debate on this issue . 
then we come to the rather delicate issue of labelling . 
we do not know that . 
a few would say that it would be worth it . 
a few would not care . 
where do we go from here ? 
is it all valid research ? 
is mandatory labelling the full and best answer ? 
it indicates : 
has it learned nothing from the hrdc *UNK* ? 
maybe not . 
we need to have that done . 
i thank my hon. colleagues from the bloc . 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
i listened to his demonstration . 
mr. reed elley : 
personally i would not know the answer to the particular question . 
we must look at all sides of the issue . 
mr. dick proctor ( palliser , ndp ) : 
i will be sharing my time with my colleague from kamloops . 
this has generated a lot interest in my constituency . 
to quote in part from a letter from the *UNK* family : 
he said : 
he ended by saying : 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
mr. dick proctor : 
this is a developing area for all of us . 
it is to our *UNK* that we have done that . 
we do not know what we are eating . 
it is an increasing reality . 
it is everywhere . 
what causes all of this ? 
it is increasing . 
this is a very important topic . 
mr. speaker , you have a *UNK* look on your face . 
allow me to continue . 
this article refers to *UNK* *UNK* . 
by 1999 his *UNK* were *UNK* to all three . 
what is the point of this ? 
is this an absolute *UNK* system ? 
we do not know the answer to that . 
many people say it is not . 
we should be concerned . 
why would we not want to do that ? 
we do it for all sorts of other things . 
what does the government do ? 
mr. john o ' reilly ( haliburton-victoria-brock , lib. ) : 
i automatically think of *UNK* and california . 
mr. nelson riis : 
mr. rick borotsik ( brandon-souris , pc ) : 
mr. nelson riis : 
that is all we are saying . 
i remember the debate around *UNK* foods . 
mr. rick borotsik ( brandon-souris , pc ) : 
there is absolutely no question about that . 
canada is an *UNK* of a number of food products . 
we in canada are an export nation . 
we will be seen as the bread *UNK* of the world . 
that is not the case . 
there are a number of concerns . 
that is what we have to do . 
that is where the federal government comes into play . 
we may well have to *UNK* label . 
what will that do ? 
what happens with *UNK* of our food products ? 
how do we *UNK* ? 
the hon. member from kamloops made some very valid points . 
industry is probably its own worst enemy . 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
in this context , how can we export ? 
there is a world trade problem . 
mr. rick borotsik : 
we recognize that commodity has actually grown in europe . 
there has to be a global agreement . 
mr. greg thompson ( new brunswick southwest , pc ) : 
there are *UNK* degrees of genetically modified foods . 
that would be an *UNK* . 
many people are *UNK* to the brazil *UNK* . 
what happens then ? 
it is a process that never ends . 
the same survey was taken in other countries of the world . 
the fear is out there . 
the agricultural community has to be *UNK* of that fear . 
there can be a *UNK* to it . 
we want safeguards built in that can work . 
enforcement would be almost impossible . 
it would be very tough on the agricultural community . 
mr. greg thompson : 
let us take a look at company called *UNK* . 
mr. nelson riis : 
mr. speaker , my supplementary question involves *UNK* . 
mr. greg thompson : 
they would be held *UNK* by a huge corporate giant . 
mr. odina desrochers ( lotbinière , bq ) : 
this issue has been *UNK* studied . 
let us begin with the international context . 
those were my comments regarding the economic side of the issue . 
people have been fighting for 15 or 20 years . 
*UNK* farmers have made enormous efforts . 
this is a matter of common sense . 
the federal government must act quickly . 
it reads as follows : 
experts will be in *UNK* . 
mr. gilles-a . 
there were about 50 people in *UNK* . 
they both helped me to prepare this consultation process . 
all the participants showed concern about that . 
production costs vary greatly . 
what are the benefits and the *UNK* for the producers ? 
that is a question i have . 
what are the effects of *UNK* on the environment ? 
what are the social consequences of the introduction of *UNK* ? 
this is a worrisome question . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
that is important . 
again this is important . 
i will give an example . 
we see that in a *UNK* pace . 
i am interested in it and i know my constituents are . 
why do we do that ? 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
i have three *UNK* of documents . 
mr. lynn myers : 
we as a government will continue to provide it . 
mr. stéphan tremblay ( lac-saint-jean , bq ) : 
that may be true . 
we cannot take chances when these are at stake . 
who *UNK* these issues ? 
should there not be an international authority ? 
several authorities may already be examining those issues . 
who will be responsible for *UNK* ? 
are my fellow citizens and myself being used as *UNK* *UNK* ? 
i am concerned . 
i have no problem with that . 
i think this is a fundamental issue . 
that is what we need at this time . 
who is responsible ? 
we have a pretty good idea . 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
they talk about health , the environment and *UNK* . 
mr. stéphan tremblay : 
we saw this also in seattle . 
in this instance , the voice democracy was heard . 
mrs. madeleine dalphond-guiral ( laval centre , bq ) : 
but it still raises several issues . 
this is not very reassuring . 
he managed to do that through genetic *UNK* . 
have you ever looked at these labels , mr. speaker ? 
we are talking about millions of people . 
these countries are all in the far east . 
i do not need to name names . 
everyone knows who they are . 
this is getting pretty close to *UNK* *UNK* . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
why do i say that ? 
that too *UNK* the commitment of our government . 
i have a question for the hon. member . 
where is the *UNK* million hiding ? 
where did it go ? 
why was it not spent ? 
mrs. madeleine dalphond-guiral : 
mr. steve mahoney ( mississauga west , lib. ) : 
who would object to that ? 
it is an interesting concept . 
actually , they were *UNK* *UNK* . 
they *UNK* a leak and never got off the ground . 
they tried doing it many years ago . 
this is rather old stuff . 
it did not work . 
the market was not there . 
i think we should . 
that is not true . 
it would not surprise me . 
we have seen it before . 
it is trying to turn itself inside out . 
i have not heard its position . 
i want to share a couple of quotes . 
he had his hat and boots on . 
will it change its position ? 
will that be the case for *UNK* ? 
will they line up and vote here ? 
it is truly a mystery . 
it is an absolutely amazing sight . 
an hon. member : 
it is a mess . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
it is a mess in a political process . 
an hon. member : 
the member is getting worried . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
i am not worried . 
mr. antoine dubé : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. steve mahoney : 
we know the position of the bloc . 
the member knows that the government led the way . 
we are doing work in this area . 
i give the example of health products . 
we all know that there was quite a controversy . 
i am not a *UNK* or a doctor . 
the research was done by health canada .

mr. steve mahoney ( mississauga west , lib. ) : 
i will let people think about that . 
there are tremendous *UNK* , virtually on a daily basis . 
mr. antoine dubé ( lévis-et-chutes-de-la-chaudière , bq ) : 
how much will this cost ? 
these are civilized nations . 
i would like to hear his explanation of this . 
we know what voluntary codes mean . 
they are almost never applied . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
mr. speaker , i am curious about the question . 
this is where i have some concern . 
we are . 
we already have voluntary labelling . 
mrs. pauline picard : 
sit down , sit down . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
voluntary labelling is a totally different issue . 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
i was interested in the bloc member ' s question . 
i have a question for the hon. member for mississauga west . 
he represents a great part of ontario . 
never mind that . 
mr. steve mahoney : 
mr. howard hilstrom ( selkirk-interlake , canadian alliance ) : 
as a result it is paying penalties for that . 
farmer choice would also fall . 
no one has any problem with that . 
there is nothing the matter with that . 
we need to restore those forests . 
there is *UNK* of *UNK* *UNK* into *UNK* . 
that gives the companies the incentive to continue their research . 
he cannot dictate his costs to anybody else . 
we have to look at the background on this . 
in any endeavour this is an impossible measure to meet . 
it has been that way for years . 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
how can the companies wash their hands of all this ? 
however , i want to get back to the producers . 
mr. howard hilstrom : 
mr. alex shepherd ( durham , lib. ) : 
the reality is that the debate is somewhat *UNK* . 
this is part of the labelling process . 
it seems to me that what people want to say- 
ms. hélène alarie : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
i will pay much closer attention . 
mr. alex shepherd : 
we are consuming genetically modified foods every day . 
the consumer is far better off with these genetic changes . 
there are of course limitations to genetic *UNK* . 
we have a labelling system already in canada . 
it is *UNK* canadian beef into the european union . 
it is *UNK* *UNK* into the european union . 
it is *UNK* many of our agricultural products . 
this is a great opportunity for canadian agriculture . 
canadian farmers have been at the forefront . 
i was impressed . 
why is this important ? 
this is a tremendous accomplishment for canadians . 
people are concerned about genetically altered food . 
there has been too much *UNK* and not enough science . 
i would like to end on that note . 
i believe that is happening . 
mrs. pauline picard ( drummond , bq ) : 
this raises several questions : 
why are plants and foods genetically modified ? 
who is benefiting from that ? 
what are the benefits to consumers ? 
what are the economic and trade issues ? 
what are the social repercussions of the *UNK* ? 
what are the regulations on *UNK* ? 
and what is the position of the federal government on *UNK* ? 
i congratulate my colleague on this . 
what are the effects of *UNK* on health ? 
there is currently no analysis being done . 
*UNK* *UNK* are very powerful . 
they often do for partisan purposes . 
but it is often to the *UNK* of the public . 
could it be because of the nature of what we eat ? 
but there are food *UNK* problems . 
so , these lands offer an opportunity . 
actually , *UNK* are not systematically tested . 
this reduces risks while not eliminating them completely . 
i do not want to stand up for *UNK* as such . 
it is *UNK* . 
it is the same thing with drugs . 
i ask my colleagues not to be *UNK* . 
mrs. pauline picard : 
i want to *UNK* out another fact . 
it took her one year of *UNK* work . 
i have that list . 
mr. serge cardin ( sherbrooke , bq ) : 
i will begin my speech with a question . 
the bloc quebecois has taken a clear *UNK* on the issue . 
they were asked to answer two questions . 
governments have no regard for the public ' ' . 
labelling should be mandatory . 
many questions remain unanswered . 
they are politically modified *UNK* . 
mrs. pauline picard ( drummond , bq ) : 
why do we genetically *UNK* plants and foods ? 
mr. serge cardin : 
they had a number of concerns . 
they were concerned primarily with ethics . 
they were wondering how far this will go . 
all reasons are good . 
i am wondering . 
ethics is important . 
some people do not want to eat them . 
we should inform them . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. dennis j. mills ( broadview-greenwood , lib. ) : 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
i see the minister of industry . 
i have a problem with the present . 
that is what *UNK* me . 
mr. dennis j. mills : 
at the basis of that is food production . 
mr. rick casson ( lethbridge , canadian alliance ) : 
fuel costs are up . 
these are all issues of concern to the agriculture community . 
i want to be get back to the labelling . 
mr. dennis j. mills : 
we are debating today . 
we do it in business . 
they have a difficult time *UNK* that . 
i for one would be happy to take up that challenge . 
mr. david price ( compton-stanstead , pc ) : 
*UNK* control products have been a big item as of late . 
people have been treating their *UNK* with them . 
that type of situation has caused many problems . 
canada is a world leader in *UNK* . 
there are concerns . 
i have a personal example . 
*UNK* in my area had been *UNK* and then cut . 
the *UNK* *UNK* *UNK* the street . 
they favour foods that provide tangible benefits . 
the simple part is the change of labels . 
this could provide *UNK* value to the customer . 
what is this funding for ? 
they also operate independent of the royal society itself . 
canadians want to take part in the dialogue on food *UNK* . 
that is money and effort well allocated and well spent . 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
i had *UNK* that there was only two minutes . 
mr. joe mcguire : 
mr. antoine dubé ( lévis-et-chutes-de-la-chaudière , bq ) : 
it is therefore a public concern . 
eight out of ten were mothers . 
my father was a farmer . 
most farmers are responsible people . 
there are many kinds of pesticides , of course . 
there is a certain analogy to be made with *UNK* . 
it must be *UNK* to . 
this would be absurd . 
she was the first woman to become an *UNK* in quebec . 
this is quite something . 
that dates her , but it is true . 
her father was a *UNK* in this area .

criminal code 
mr. maurice vellacott ( wanuskewin , canadian alliance ) moved : 
my motion opposes such efforts . 
in fact the more numerous convictions indicate otherwise . 
that is clearly not the case . 
it is a good law . 
it was well *UNK* at the time . 
section 43 strikes that proper balance . 
teachers share this exact same concern . 
that would be tragic . 
parenting has always been a challenge . 
it is for these reasons that i brought forward this initiative . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
mr. bill blaikie ( winnipeg-transcona , ndp ) : 
that is a mistake . 
we are human beings . 
we want to eliminate that capacity for judgment . 
that is a mistake . 
i can think of obvious examples . 
there has been all kinds corporal punishment . 
i am not making an argument for corporal punishment . 
mr. tom wappel ( scarborough southwest , lib. ) : 
having said that , i think the subject matter is important . 
the motion calls for the federal government to defend the section . 
i want to take a look at the section specifically . 
it states : 
it applies to child and *UNK* . 
it continues : 
that is *UNK* important . 
it continues : 
the section is reasonable . 
i think it should be maintained . 
with that i agree . 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
it is a very trying time . 
it becomes a very *UNK* and grey issue . 
parents know best . 
that is a good thing . 
yes , there is . 
there have been some high profile cases before the courts . 
it is understandable that there is some *UNK* . 
in his legal *UNK* , he said : 
mr. garry breitkreuz ( yorkton-melville , canadian alliance ) : 
that is why this resolution is necessary . 
i will give a couple of very good examples of that . 
the canadian teachers ' federation states : 
we have laws that address abuse . 
i am a former teacher . 
that is why we should not change this . 
this document states : 
the second example is the court challenges program . 
this is what sections 43 says . 
how does section 43 operate ? 
mr. maurice vellacott ( wanuskewin , canadian alliance ) : 
the record has to be clear . 
i can cite from my own family situation . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is there unanimous consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
adjournment proceedings 
gasoline prices 
mr. yvon godin ( acadie-bathurst , ndp ) : 
at the time , i said : 
taxes went up by only 1 cent . 
it changed every day . 
in my book , that is almost like stealing . 
but , speaking of taxes , i will give an example . 
it did not do that . 
in fact , it did the opposite . 
it is unfortunate that i do not have more time . 
again , it missed a golden opportunity . 
the increase in oil prices is probably temporary . 
foreign affairs 
mr. gordon earle ( halifax west , ndp ) : 
the minister of national defence stated : 
we cannot yet take a position . 
of course we can take a stand . 
we should take a stand and we must take a stand . 
canada needs to take the lead . 
the foreign affairs minister said on march 22 : 
the *UNK* to build walls should be resisted . 
this is a serious matter . 
canada ' s role in international affairs hangs in the balance . 
i ask the liberal government for an answer to my question . 
military affairs *UNK* john *UNK* said of the proposed system : 
it is money down the *UNK* 
the government has a choice . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
the hon. member for saskatoon-rosetown-biggar . 
national parks 
mr. dennis gruending ( saskatoon-rosetown-biggar , ndp ) : 
rightly so . 
sadly , this vision has become *UNK* . 
i want to use the example of prince albert national park . 
this is not an attack on the integrity of the park . 
one wonders what the minister might be waiting for . 
fisheries 
mr. peter stoffer ( sackville-musquodoboit valley-eastern shore , ndp ) : 
negotiations will be ongoing in the future . 
we all know that elections happen . 
i will say this much to the hon. member . 
that is a fact . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
order , please .

mr. rick casson ( lethbridge , canadian alliance ) : 
no one wants to see people suffer when they fall ill . 
it is time for the government to go . 
however he did not bring it forward . 
why would they be doing this ? 
why is that ? 
it is because their rich friends want their taxes reduced .

people say *UNK* obligation for the banks . 
they will pass on the bill to us . 
our fees will go up again . 
i would like to speak very briefly about the process . 
members know the way standing committees work . 
that is the bottom line . 
i do not think the compliance costs will be that significant . 
mr. jim abbott ( kootenay-columbia , canadian alliance ) : 
i find the process to be completely unacceptable . 
it is a bill that is vital . 
i believe it is in *UNK* land . 
of course they will . 
mrs. pierrette venne ( saint-bruno-saint-hubert , bq ) : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
i am sorry to interrupt the hon. member . 
mr. john cummins : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
we now have a quorum . 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
i am very proud to have worked with him . 
the main purpose of the amendment is obvious . 
this bill moves in that direction . 
once again , a *UNK* . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is the house ready for the question ? 
some hon. members : 
question . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
yea . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
some hon. members : 
nay . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
in my opinion the nays have it . 
and more than five members having risen : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
the recorded division on the proposed motion stands deferred . 
mr. richard marceau : 
i will ask to speak in order to introduce them . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

mr. roy cullen :

the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

mr. roy cullen : 
mr. darrel stinson : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i would like to know what the protocol is . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
this is what is being considered by the clerks . 
what is before the house now are the amendments . 
it must be done by the parties . 
mr. richard marceau ( charlesbourg , bq ) : 
i can only deplore it . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
that is a good way to do it . 
mr. jim abbott ( kootenay-columbia , canadian alliance ) : 
therefore , i move :

i also move : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
the amendments are in order . 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
the conservative party supports the broad principles . 
international money capital markets annually are very much affected . 
we need to do this right away . 
the bill is one of which our party is supportive . 
the amendments as well are supported by our party . 
all the indicators are there . 
the government is letting down the side . 
it has not lived up to the *UNK* . 
it has not responded to requests from the rcmp . 
what we want to hear is that the government is listening . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
mr. peter mackay : 
the indicators are there . 
the ears are closed . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
private members ' business 
oath of allegiance to the flag of canada act 
the *UNK* century gave us *UNK* . 
the 20th century gave us our flag . 
we have a national anthem . 
why would we need anything more ? 
the answer is simple . 
an oath would *UNK* our commitment to these values . 
it represents two official languages working together . 
it represents democracy and freedom . 
mr. *UNK* wrote : 
i agree with mr. *UNK* . 
*UNK* patriotism tends to lead to dangerous consequences . 
mr. inky mark ( dauphin-swan river , canadian alliance ) : 
national symbols are very important . 
our national flag is respected around the world . 
that is why i support the bill . 
at this time the criminal code does not protect our flag . 
oaths are not *UNK* statements of goodwill . 
mr. pierre de savoye ( portneuf , bq ) : 
recognizing and respecting a national flag is one thing . 
making it the object of *UNK* *UNK* is another . 
patriotism is not about taking an oath . 
when would it be used ? 
who would be *UNK* or encouraged to take it ? 
france is a good example . 
a flag is the symbol of a nation ' s values . 
what are these values ? 
perhaps . 
the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century could not do better . 
the bloc quebecois opposes this bill . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
mr. mark muise ( west nova , pc ) : 
we must ask ourselves why this is the case . 
however i think the problem goes much further than that . 
mrs. brenda chamberlain ( guelph-wellington , lib. ) : 
he said that symbols are important . 
i agree . 
i think it is important to point that out . 
unfortunately , members of the bloc are against this bill . 
quebecers certainly are proud canadians . 
our flag is recognized all over the world . 
these are all things that the conservative member recognizes . 
he thought that would be a good thing . 
it will show our love for canada . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
adjournment proceedings 
human resources development 
we may never be *UNK* . 
our share was by far a minority share . 
could that be it ? 
surely not . 
i do not know . 
national defence 
mr. gordon earle ( halifax west , ndp ) : 
which recommendations does he see as worthwhile ? 
which ones will he implement and in what timeframe ? 
that is appalling . 
a *UNK* *UNK* indeed . 
anything less would be an insult . 
the canadian forces must reflect the *UNK* that is canada . 
diversity within the canadian forces is something that we truly value . 
human resources development 
mr. paul crête ( kamouraska-rivière-du-loup-témiscouata-les basques , bq ) : 
that is why we are still talking about it . 
that is a better rate than a bank . 
i think that is a darn good record . 
all the various players made comments . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
order , please . 
i must interrupt the hon. member at this point .

mr. bob kilger : 
the deputy speaker : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
mr. daniel turp ( beauharnois-salaberry , bq ) : 
the bill has to do with offences committed in canada . 
these are amendments to the citizenship act . 
mr. john reynolds ( west vancouver-sunshine coast , canadian alliance ) : 
let me turn to the history and evolution of this initiative . 
the *UNK* will be located in the *UNK* , *UNK* . 
we trust this is correct . 
there are two ways we can approach these concerns . 
on that front the *UNK* is *UNK* . 
bill c-19 requires a lot of study and review . 
the deputy speaker : 
is the house ready for the question ?

budget implementation act , 2000 
mr. charlie penson ( peace river , canadian alliance ) : 
what does that really mean ? 
however , the data is clear and *UNK* . 
that is a concern . 
i say that it is a failing in the report . 
we know that interest rates are starting to rise . 
surely to *UNK* 
*UNK* our currency will not serve us *UNK* 
mr. yvan loubier ( saint-hyacinthe-bagot , bq ) : 
we have much criticism to level at it . 
this is a disgrace . 
that is a lot . 
the employers and the employees pay . 
he has *UNK* the employment insurance plan . 
he let the ship *UNK* . 
it is hypocritical to present things like that . 
it is to maintain housing that has already been built . 
that is the difference . 
why ? 
and what has been the result ? 
this is unacceptable . 
this is really *UNK* . 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
clearly the budget missed the point on that . 
mr. chuck cadman ( surrey north , canadian alliance ) : 
with a balanced budget the surtax should have been eliminated . 
it is a disgrace . 
let us break our *UNK* process into very simple terms . 
the minister should be absolutely ashamed of his actions . 
and we wonder why we are *UNK* billion in debt . 
and we wonder why we are facing a brain drain . 
they appear to have finally *UNK* in . 
in the budget there was very little for health care . 
a national plan seems to be seriously lacking . 
the deficit was *UNK* solely on the backs of canadian taxpayers . 
canadians expect much more . 
the government has gotten very old and very tired . 
mrs. christiane gagnon ( québec , bq ) : 
this is the mark that i would give to the liberals . 
we noticed a second thing about this budget . 
the project is being *UNK* . 
that is what we see . 
the deputy speaker : 
i want to read this for their benefit . 
imagine that . 
let me give an example . 
*UNK* , that means tax cuts . 
contrast that with the liberal government . 
the liberals simply do not get it . 
consumer spending would increase . 
that is what they have done . 
that formula is simply this . 
higher taxes equal a *UNK* economy . 
we could almost get excited about it . 
here is the real truth . 
does that sound like a caring , generous government ? 
i do not think so . 
all the time the government has blown its spending budget . 
canadians are waiting for it and they have not received it . 
mr. gerry ritz ( battlefords-lloydminster , canadian alliance ) : 
he who has the money makes the rules . 
let us look at these pieces . 
we should not expect any action on this very soon . 
we will have to continue to pay it . 
that is a big point . 
it is cost *UNK* because of the tax law . 
they are good citizens . 
our dollar is worth less than 67 cents today . 
welcome to the 1990s . 
the canadian people will leave them behind . 
unfortunately they are not . 
mr. derrek konrad ( prince albert , canadian alliance ) : 
we have been saying that for quite some time . 
the report makes statements like : 
the report goes on to say : 
i note the use of the *UNK* of audit . 
in section *UNK* he says : 
it is getting to be a major issue . 
the department has no updated *UNK* . 
what can i say ? 
what can we say about that ? 
why should canadian taxpayers be happy about statistics like those ? 
this includes people from the first nations and immigrants . 
does debt repayment amount to anything ? 
not at a bit . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) :

mr. richard marceau : 
i therefore move : 
that motion no. 9 , in paragraph 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
the amendments moved by the hon. member are in order . 
mr. roger gallaway ( sarnia-lambton , lib. ) : 
it is a global phenomenon . 
that is not a very radical idea . 
this process already exists in the bank act . 
important questions about the true nature of democracy arise . 
in recent times these obligations have become *UNK* . 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
mr. roy cullen : 
the proposed amendment would not therefore provide any additional safeguards . 
mr. jim abbott ( kootenay-columbia , canadian alliance ) : 
i continue to feel a sense of *UNK* over this bill . 
i am very concerned about that . 
i will speak to group no. 3 specifically . 
unfortunately that did not happen . 
this is terribly confusing . 
those are the comments of the official opposition . 
the *UNK* is getting concerned .

mr. bob kilger : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the amendments will certainly add value to the bill . 
they are constantly moving into new areas of activity . 
that would create an unnecessary burden . 
this will be spelled out in the regulations . 
with this law we will do the same . 
the bill specifically calls for respecting *UNK* privilege . 
let us waste no time in passing this legislation . 
mr. richard marceau ( charlesbourg , bq ) : 
it is a third victory for the bloc quebecois . 
these three *UNK* are quite impressive . 
canada meets its obligations in this regard . 
on the whole , this is a good bill . 
mr. jim abbott ( kootenay-columbia , canadian alliance ) : 
it is not only organized crime . 
i can give an example . 
that is the parliamentary process . 
we listened to different professional agencies . 
count him . 
i *UNK* that to the attention of the parliamentary secretary . 
my colleague from charlesbourg went to that meeting . 
it was only logical . 
it has been the *UNK* of *UNK* . 
that motion actually had some merit . 
what happened ? 
this is important . 
i just despair for this process .

why are you minister if you are not doing anything ? 
you don ' t have any responsibility . 
the speaker : 
order , please . 
the hon. member for wanuskewin . 
mr. maurice vellacott :

there are five words *UNK* added . 
mr. maurice vellacott ( wanuskewin , canadian alliance ) :

they do not want to help them get jobs . 
the speaker : 
the hon. leader of the bloc quebecois . 
* * *

i do not want to make accusations .

ms. val meredith ( south surrey-white rock-langley , canadian alliance ) :

what about those other airlines ? 
i do not think they want that .

mr. grant hill ( macleod , canadian alliance ) : 
i ask my question again . 
hon. herb gray ( deputy prime minister , lib. ) : 
* * * 
national defence 
mr. gordon earle ( halifax west , ndp ) : 
what is the prime minister ' s position ? 
we have both indicated concerns . 
mr. gordon earle ( halifax west , ndp ) : 
that is all that is going on . 
mr. david price ( compton-stanstead , pc ) : 
in fact the file is moving . 
mr. david price ( compton-stanstead , pc ) : 
* * * 
environment 
mr. rick limoges ( windsor-st . 
this coming summer will be no exception . 
mr. speaker , the hon. member is correct . 
we are approaching the subject on two fronts . 
these negotiations will continue until october . 
* * *

business of the house 
mr. chuck strahl ( fraser valley , canadian alliance ) : 
we will wait for that . 
government orders 
proceeds of crime ( money laundering ) act 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
the hon. member for kootenay-columbia has 22 minutes left in debate . 
mr. jim abbott ( kootenay-columbia , canadian alliance ) : 
let us now turn to the bill itself . 
this is a quote from that report : 
first , this activity is a criminal activity . 
that is it . 
again , we have taken a look at that . 
he went on to say : 
it was really very unfortunate . 
it was just a *UNK* thick . 
mr. *UNK* went on to say : 
that is not a false threat at all . 
that is not *UNK* . 
there are things that we can join hands on . 
mr. dick proctor ( palliser , ndp ) : 
there is a potential for charter *UNK* . 
in addition , the issue of *UNK* offences could be addressed . 
those are the points i wish to make . 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
it is a huge issue . 
the issue of resources is very important . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
is the house ready for the question ? 
some hon. members : 
question . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
i declare the motion carried . 
mr. bob kilger : 
madam speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
suspension of sitting 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( the sitting of the house was suspended at *UNK* p.m. ) 
sitting resumed 
( the house resumed at *UNK* p.m. ) 
* * * 
business of the house 
bill *UNK* 
madam speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i move : 
*UNK* *UNK* ' ' ; and 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
( motion agreed to ) 
* * * 
income tax amendments act , 1999 
mr. monte solberg ( medicine hat , canadian alliance ) : 
any objective review of the facts will bear that assertion out . 
i think it is absolutely the case . 
it is getting larger . 
sadly , apparently the government is deaf to that message . 
it does not seem to understand . 
the government cannot seem to figure that out . 
we must beat down *UNK* regulations that have *UNK* their *UNK* . 
we have high marginal tax rates . 
their reward is to pay higher taxes . 
we have an educated public . 
we have great human resources . 
that is a shame . 
why is that ? 
what does that mean ? 
the alberta government understands that . 
how do they do that ? 
we *UNK* that system . 
we do not agree with it . 
however , how does it do that ? 
how come it is not going bankrupt ? 
how does it fund all those things ? 
is it because they are *UNK* ? 
of course not . 
that is critical . 
it is time we learned that lesson . 
how do we turn this ship around ? 
it is a single rate tax proposal . 
it has three elements . 
it has allowed that to happen . 
``a low dollar is good ' ' , he says . 
unbelievable . 
canadians , individually , are poorer for it . 
*UNK* 
i will conclude by moving an amendment . 
i move : 
what are marginal tax rates ? 
there have been 18 straight quarters of growth in the country . 
let me give a comparison . 
a *UNK* 
the speaker : 
i do not know how we are going to divide this . 
mr. roy cullen : 
mr. speaker , i was building up to a question . 
mr. monte solberg : 
it is the wrong system . 
mr. deepak obhrai ( calgary east , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. monte solberg : 
mr. roy cullen : 
i have heard it . 
mr. monte solberg : 
that is not a tax cut . 
that is simply not the case . 
mr. deepak obhrai ( calgary east , canadian alliance ) : 
it is a simple question . 
where are these tax cuts ? 
i do not know where these tax cuts are . 
canadians do not see them . 
i would like to address two areas . 
a constituent of mine is having problems with revenue canada . 
you *UNK* to the minister . 
is that how we deal with canadians ? 
is that happening ? 
no , it is not happening . 
this is becoming a trend which is quite disturbing . 
where is this tax relief ? 
a constituent came into my office . 
this disability claim is *UNK* ' ' . 
i do not know . 
do members know what is killing them ? 
that is the problem . 
these are not people who are trying to *UNK* . 
he says this *UNK* . 
that is fine and i accept it . 
we are proud of what is going on . 
however , i have a question to ask of him . 
that is great . 
absolutely not . 
i can name a couple of them , bombardier and *UNK* . 
these are the companies that are taking advantage of it . 
the canadian economy is growing . 
lowering taxes is the *UNK* criterion . 
what does that tell us ? 
our government refuses to do that . 
that is good for canada . 
international trade provides jobs . 
we have started to lose ground to them rapidly . 
it is a question of priorities . 
those two provinces are optimistic . 
the answer is simple . 
the federal government is refusing to recognize the results . 
it is refusing to recognize the evidence that is out there . 
there is evidence of those provinces reducing taxes . 
the european union started reducing taxes . 
nothing will stop them . 
they will be going down to mexico . 
the speaker : 
the amendment is in order . 
mr. deepak obhrai : 
it is *UNK* important that we say what is right . 
mr. gerry ritz ( battlefords-lloydminster , canadian alliance ) : 
to whom do we go ? 
would the hon. member care to comment ? 
mr. deepak obhrai : 
there is inconsistency . 
where can people go ? 
mr. bill gilmour ( nanaimo-alberni , canadian alliance ) : 
we will be competing with china over the next several decades . 
the government is trying to penalize industry . 
mr. deepak obhrai : 
i hope not . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
we have these trade *UNK* out west . 
i asked her if she had any other problems . 
she was a very *UNK* lady . 
i think people should know that . 
it is really quite ridiculous . 
furthermore , this bill also covers two *UNK* . 
we have been calling for that for six years . 
we are now going to keep it there ' ' . 
it is a *UNK* i wish i could use here . 
we would be able to communicate so much better . 
the point i am making is a very important one . 
now it claims the level is flat . 
let us hope the government keeps it that way . 
there is the elimination of an individual surtax . 
i guess we should give them credit when credit is due . 
it is rather interesting . 
one could argue that it is only fair . 
the bill addresses a number of other issues . 
one i found particularly interesting was the one on communal organizations . 
there are a number of such organizations . 
instead they all live on it . 
actually they are *UNK* . 
all the young people are taught to work . 
this seems fair . 
the costs are paid by the *UNK* . 
that is also a form of *UNK* . 
they always have a reduced exemption . 
we have been quite consistent in this regard . 
there should not be a *UNK* . 
our solution 17 does the same thing . 
there are a number of other issues in the bill . 
it is a *UNK* *UNK* . 
that is the case with some economic *UNK* . 
canadian families are taxed to death . 
i noticed that my *UNK* *UNK* was *UNK* . 
he would have a job for a day . 
the *UNK* has become quite a large issue in the country . 
that is what we are doing . 
i do not know what the number is . 
that is quite an issue . 
i think that is regrettable . 
the hon. member talked about the flat tax . 
i do not have the information on solution 17 . 
mr. ken epp : 
he could not have asked a better question . 
it is not . 
it is an equalization of the tax burden . 
the basic exemptions are increased dramatically . 
it is not a flat tax per *UNK* . 
it is a single rate tax . 
mr. maurice vellacott ( wanuskewin , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. ken epp : 
i am speaking as a *UNK* . 
we propose to take a constant percentage . 
they got into a higher bracket . 
mr. grant hill ( macleod , canadian alliance ) : 
they put it under the table . 
could my colleague comment on that ? 
mr. ken epp : 
yes , i think that is deplorable . 
mr. bill gilmour ( nanaimo-alberni , canadian alliance ) : 
it is almost a state of denial . 
we have interprovincial trade barriers , for example . 
we have talked about it . 
what about our debt ? 
back in those days we had a very tiny debt . 
canadians would like the government to address that . 
canadians are on their *UNK* . 
all levels of government have to do that . 
these are the economies we as canadians have to deal with . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
i have to interrupt the hon. member at this time . 
private members ' business 
office of the correctional *UNK* 
mrs. pierrette venne ( saint-bruno-saint-hubert , bq ) moved : 
i should be noted that the reasons for complaints are many . 
if it is not the *UNK* 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mrs. pierrette venne : 
there are only two sentences left . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
mrs. pierrette venne : 
and besides , there is another important element , of course . 
we are living in times of tremendous change . 
is our justice system working ? 
is it indeed protecting our most vulnerable citizens ? 
our government was well prepared to deal with those difficulties . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
the member is really *UNK* the minister with her motion . 
i can understand the member ' s frustration . 
we have lost our autonomy . 
i commend the hon. member for bringing this motion forward . 
i certainly sympathize with her frustration with the system . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
she has the floor . 
mrs. pierrette venne : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) :

government orders 
canada national parks act 
the seven communities will remain as special places . 
we will work to ensure their continued sustainability . 
the plans will respect the provisions in the act . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
my love of the parks *UNK* over the last 40 years . 
i love the park . 
we were preparing a youth camp for summer activities . 
i will never forget it . 
we made that little compromise . 
i was not a well paid person . 
we were able to enjoy them . 
it is now really only for the very rich . 
that is a policy which is very regrettable . 
*UNK* is probably the best example . 
that is a mistake as far as i am concerned . 
we are talking today about national parks . 
i believe that we need to respect the land . 
i believe that we need to respect the parks . 
i think that is important . 
it is a matter of individual responsibility . 
that is an error . 
there are other things as well . 
that is a totally *UNK* set of priorities . 
i do not know if anyone here knows that song . 
mr. mauril bélanger : 
please do not sing it . 
mr. ken epp : 
our native friends have that same *UNK* . 
that is a totally *UNK* priority . 
mr. mauril bélanger : 
that is total nonsense . 
mr. ken epp : 
no , it is not nonsense . 
that is wrong . 
talk about *UNK* , talk about the environment . 
it would have to be debated in parliament . 
that is not the case anymore . 
now it allows simply for orders in council . 
no public *UNK* is required . 
i think that is an error . 
i want to talk a bit about that . 
tourism is so important to our country . 
it is economically important . 
i will not *UNK* that . 
it is important . 
we need a dialogue between them . 
we need to come to agreements . 
that is most important . 
the others have been *UNK* silent . 
ms. jocelyne girard-bujold ( jonquière , bq ) : 
the bloc quebecois supports the principle of the bill . 
this is very important . 
this park is located in ontario on lake *UNK* . 
the existing legislation provides fines for *UNK* wildlife .

the speaker : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
canada national parks act 
ms. jocelyne girard-bujold ( jonquière , bq ) : 
on the following page , the commission continues as follows : 
the following are some of its recommendations : 
today , its budget is *UNK* million . 
its staff has been reduced from 4,000 to 3,000 . 
he said : 
and i tell you i am proud of this . 
it was not me who said that . 
such attitudes are revolting . 
the proposed legislation also provides for the designation of historic sites . 
that is unacceptable . 
the weather is nice and *UNK* today . 
mr. pat martin ( winnipeg centre , ndp ) : 
it states : 
it is a very canadian thing . 
that sort of struck me . 
we feel this is very important . 
this would *UNK* the process for creating new national parks . 
however , we have to treat these seven communities very differently . 
they are unique in canada . 
the hon. member used the example of *UNK* sheep . 
there has been a great deal of interest in the bill . 
we are really getting quite specific . 
that will be in the legislation . 
it will no longer be an option . 
it will be deemed to be law . 
that would be our obligation . 
i have already talked about the *UNK* penalties . 
i approve of that wholeheartedly . 
the term *UNK* integrity comes up often . 
nobody can argue with that kind of *UNK* principle . 
that is where we have to blow the whistle . 
people recognize the term as meaning a certain thing . 
an hon. member : 
mr. pat martin ( winnipeg centre , ndp ) : 
mr. speaker , he is the member for davenport . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
it is highly desirable that these places be accessible to people . 
mr. pat martin : 
we are not advocating the *UNK* of *UNK* . 
even revenue *UNK* is not an evil thing . 
accessibility is a *UNK* sword . 
i disagree wholeheartedly . 
the other side of the question was commercialization . 
mr. ken epp : 
that is one question . 
the second one is very short . 
is the member pleased with that ? 
mr. pat martin : 
those provisions already exist . 
we are not threatened by that . 
mr. mark muise ( west nova , pc ) : 
i would call that a very significant increase . 
where will these people turn to ? 
who will be their advocate ? 
they see no solution in this bill . 
is it not somewhat ironic when one thinks of it ? 
i have many concerns about this proposed piece of legislation . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
is the house ready for the question ? 
some hon. members : 
question . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
some hon. members : 
yea . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
some hon. members : 
nay . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
in my opinion the yeas have it . 
and more than five members having risen : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mr. mauril bélanger : 
madam speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
private members ' business 
labelling of genetically modified foods 
ms. hélène alarie ( louis-hébert , bq ) moved : 
why this debate and reflection ? 
the answer is very simple . 
what is substantial *UNK* ? 
the assessment of risks remains a difficult scientific issue . 
where is the problem ? 
mr. *UNK* adds : 
he adds : 
the word profit is a constantly *UNK* one in this theory . 
are we part of nature ? 
why not *UNK* to nature ? 
*UNK* , the result is the same . 
agricultural *UNK* in the new millennium ' ' . 
the government recognizes that consumers want choice . 
government orders 
bill *UNK* of time allocation 
madam speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
private members ' business 
labelling of genetically modified foods 
the house resumed consideration of the motion . 
mr. grant hill ( macleod , canadian alliance ) : 
there are early *UNK* *UNK* . 
this plant came from china . 
those are just some of the potential benefits . 
it could be done , but it would be difficult . 
it would be a *UNK* label . 
also , i would suggest that this be voluntary . 
i would much prefer a voluntary process driven by the market . 
that is the process i would use . 
i have listened to some organizations *UNK* this . 
let the consumer be aware and let the consumer choose . 
scientists are , in fact , able to do that . 
my congratulations to my colleague for bringing this debate . 
i hope the house will consider it carefully . 
mr. pat martin ( winnipeg centre , ndp ) : 
it is a basic , fundamental , health issue right . 
they have made that abundantly clear . 
health canada *UNK* products with respect to quality and safety . 
which jurisdiction is it ? 
the hon. member mentioned canola oil as an example . 
farmers cannot do that any more . 
perverse is the word for it . 
the jury is still out on that issue . 
we do not know . 
there have been mistakes . 
there have been recent examples which gave consumers cause for alarm . 
it did not want to rock the boat . 
it is a terrible problem . 
let canadians choose . 
let them know what it is they are actually eating . 
make labelling mandatory . 
mr. greg thompson ( new brunswick southwest , pc ) : 
madam speaker , what an interesting debate . 
i want to speak specifically to that . 
they have been very successful in doing that . 
i only have to mention mad cow disease . 
another example of that is atomic energy . 
one of them is in a new product called golden *UNK* . 
none of us disagree with the benefit side of it . 
it is called the *UNK* seed . 
countries would be forced to buy seed . 
those are examples of science going too far . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
( the house adjourned at *UNK* p.m. )

private members ' business 
voice mail service 
ms. libby davies ( vancouver east , ndp ) moved : 
it basically would mean *UNK* by and surviving day by day . 
but it is provided on a very *UNK* basis . 
that is something i agree with . 
it was really amazing to see how this operates . 
he was looking for work . 
other than that there is really nothing that exists . 
if it were not so serious it would be *UNK* . 
i want to go to work . 
i want to be employed . 
that is what we should do here . 
mr. charlie penson ( peace river , canadian alliance ) : 
basic telephone services is quite a different matter . 
it is a good idea . 
i think there are many *UNK* to address this concern . 
therefore , i am not in support of this motion . 
mr. john cannis ( scarborough centre , lib. ) : 
that is exactly what motion no. 361 says . 
if it warrants , it shall be done . 
we certainly know the importance of *UNK* . 
why ? 
how can society level the playing field ? 
the motion reads : 
we have to provide some assistance . 
will this be a major *UNK* on the telephone companies ? 
it would be a great public relations exercise . 
that is one thing we ought to consider as well . 
an hon. member : 
the canadian alliance party . 
mr. nelson riis : 
my apologies to my friends in the canadian alliance . 
we all agree with the idea . 
let us face it . 
an hon. member : 
what is *UNK* her ? 
mr. nelson riis : 
mr. jean-paul marchand ( québec east , bq ) : 
mr. dick proctor ( palliser , ndp ) : 
it is a coming together in support . 
the motion before us states : 
ms. sophia leung ( vancouver kingsway , lib. ) : 
mr. dennis gruending ( saskatoon-rosetown-biggar , ndp ) : 
from where will they get their telephone service ? 
the motion as it reads is not *UNK* in that way . 
ms. libby davies ( vancouver east , ndp ) : 
i absolutely will follow it up . 
that is not what it is about . 
let us be realistic about it . 
it is about creating equity in society . 
here we happen to be talking about phone service . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
some hon. members :

second reading 
mr. pierre de savoye : 
i will explain why i feel this sadness . 
these families will be in a very *UNK* situation . 
let us look at the broader picture . 
the devco mine is basically a coal mine . 
it is a fairly *UNK* substance . 
the problem is the approach being taken . 
there were a number of ways to go about it . 
in short , there were solutions . 
they could definitely cost less in the long term . 
mr. peter mancini ( sydney-victoria , ndp ) : 
i have a couple of questions for the member . 
first , he talked about money . 
these people are miners for the most part . 
they have gone underground . 
they have suffered *UNK* . 
that is just in health benefits . 
mr. pierre de savoye : 
mr. julian reed ( halton , lib. ) : 
this is a relatively simple straightforward bill . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
this is not really a very good comparison . 
these are the types of things we should be looking at . 
ms. libby davies ( vancouver east , ndp ) : 
i will deal with two issues in my comments . 
many of us were back in our ridings . 
it was really awful to watch . 
the miners wanted to be home with their families . 
what were they doing ? 
they understood what was going on . 
we do not want to see children go hungry . 
why would this mine closure make any sense ? 
why would this bill make any sense ? 
they wanted to ensure that there was local control . 
we talk a lot about community economic development . 
will child labour be used ? 
we should be investing in this local community . 
that is what we stand for in this party . 
i want to move the following amendment : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
i will get back to the hon. member . 
mr. david chatters ( athabasca , canadian alliance ) : 
what else would *UNK* the government to suddenly move so quickly ? 
it simply was not working . 
cape breton island has experienced poor economic conditions many *UNK* 
none can compare to the present day . 
people are showing a lack of confidence in the future . 
more important , what will replace those controls ? 
mr. *UNK* stated the following : 
mr. lynn myers ( waterloo-wellington , lib. ) : 
i take exception to that . 
it is very important to meet with the people there . 
it is important that we on the government side listen carefully . 
she talked about child labour in other countries . 
she talked about rumours that she had heard . 
we need to proceed in that fashion . 
that really is an out and out *UNK* . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
mr. lynn myers : 
members from the ndp know that as well . 
listen to them *UNK* instead of listening to the speech . 
they are *UNK* and trying to *UNK* things up . 
they should listen . 
what i am about to say is worth listening to . 
at the end of the day , is it perfect ? 
we understand that . 
that has been a goal of the government from the outset . 
so it is that we proceed in this important area . 
i have visited there on a number of occasions . 
why do we do that ? 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mr. dick proctor ( palliser , ndp ) : 
we will see it again with devco . 
where did we hear that kind of story before ? 
we will see absolutely the same scenario with the devco operation . 
yet no meaningful consultation has taken place to date . 
that is what we have been after . 
before i sit down i move : 
the speaker : 
i find the amendment to the amendment to be in order .

it is not . 
the speaker :

there is a byelection going on in newfoundland . 
mr. charlie penson ( peace river , canadian alliance ) : 
nothing has really changed . 
that was the first thing we did . 
why ? 
mr. charlie penson ( peace river , canadian alliance ) : 
this is not about creating jobs . 
they tried to stop its very creation . 
the alliance party should *UNK* itself with some *UNK* *UNK* .

questions on the order paper 
.[text] 
question no. *UNK* mr. svend j. robinson : 
question no. *UNK* ms. pauline picard : 
the ad hoc working group also *UNK* pilot projects . 
mr. derek lee : 
the deputy speaker : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
mr. dennis gruending ( saskatoon-rosetown-biggar , ndp ) : 
i am not going into that in much detail . 
the process is often as important as the results . 
let us talk a bit about what happened . 
this resulted in a protest . 
a little later on in january there were *UNK* strikes . 
the miners had finally had enough . 
mr. darrel stinson : 
ask the minister of finance why . 
mr. dennis gruending : 
that is true . 
i have two things to say about that . 
let us talk about the *UNK* side of it first . 
he told us about the coal coming in from *UNK* . 
he talked about the labour which is used . 
we take safety for granted . 
it gets worse . 
why ? 
mr. darrel stinson ( okanagan-shuswap , canadian alliance ) : 
skilled workers are on hand . 
i want to talk about that just for a second . 
the miners have not seen any result of that . 
the mine is being shut down . 
let us have a public inquiry . 
let us see where the money has been going . 
let us look at it . 
try to get those markets back . 
in fact , they are the worst i have seen . 
i have to admit on some grounds the work was tough . 
they kept *UNK* down time and again . 
we know it is not from people in canada . 
an hon. member : 
the nhl ? 
mr. darrel stinson : 
no , it is a shipping firm . 
mrs. michelle dockrill : 
is it *UNK* ? 
mr. darrel stinson : 
yeah , it would be *UNK* . 
an hon. member : 
the finance minister of the liberal government . 
mr. darrel stinson : 
that would be my way of looking at it . 
these men are supposed to be *UNK* . 
before i close i would like to quote mr. *UNK* : 
that is the question . 
mr. peter mancini ( sydney-victoria , ndp ) : 
the deputy speaker : 
call in the members . 
and the bells having rung : 
the deputy speaker : 
i see a quorum . 
mr. peter mancini : 
let us look at the agreement . 
the minister of natural resources came to cape breton in january . 
let us look at some of the other comparisons . 
let us look at the education allowance . 
they also received a *UNK* allowance . 
the list goes on and on . 
it would look at precedent . 
i think it is because it has a foreign *UNK* . 
i am not a young man . 
i am in my *UNK* . 
some hon. members : 
oh , oh . 
mr. peter mancini : 
the government is to sell it to a foreign company . 
do we know what that will mean ? 
cape *UNK* will not mine that coal . 
again we talk about *UNK* . 
for 30 years we made some progress . 
there are some very other important issues . 
many retired miners are receiving their pension . 
who *UNK* that pension ? 
i challenge them . 
i do not think they will do that . 
an hon. member : 
right . 
mr. peter mancini : 
i know i am right . 
it is not fair . 
mr. john mckay ( scarborough east , lib. ) : 
surely enough is enough . 
mrs. michelle dockrill : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
and the count having been taken : 
the deputy speaker : 
call in the members . 
and the bells having rung : 
the deputy speaker : 
there being a quorum , the debate shall continue . 
mr. john mckay : 
when should the government get out of this business ? 
the government has taken on that liability . 
the numbers get to be a little staggering after a while . 
again , what is enough ? 
there is never enough . 
those moneys are substantial . 
ms. louise hardy ( yukon , ndp ) : 
it is about taking the time . 
it is really *UNK* . 
that is not what democracy is . 
what the people in cape breton are facing is globalization . 
my father was born in cape breton and had to leave . 
he came from a big family of 21 children . 
this is a huge country and it is very *UNK* diverse . 
what would that mean for the people of cape breton ? 
that is not a small amount . 
miners have a tradition . 
these decisions were made in 1995 . 
it is becoming a routine practice . 
it does not want to hear . 
mr. dennis j. mills ( broadview-greenwood , lib. ) : 
i think that is the essence of this chamber . 
he *UNK* in discrimination and racism . 
he lived and worked in a very tough situation . 
mr. pierre de savoye ( portneuf , bq ) : 
these 1,000 workers have families . 
devco employees have *UNK* rights . 
for one thing , they have been paying into a pension . 
mr. pat martin ( winnipeg centre , ndp ) : 
for many years it showed a profit . 
some of those *UNK* succeeded and some of them failed . 
mr. dennis j. mills : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the deputy speaker : 
members have other obligations . 
we will avoid that , i know , in future remarks . 
mr. pat martin : 
the deputy speaker : 
and the count having been taken : 
the deputy speaker : 
i see a quorum . 
the hon. member for winnipeg centre has the floor . 
mr. pat martin : 
many things have not even been raised . 
there was a natural customer for the product . 
where ? 
it will be canada *UNK* lines . 
they were told the big lie . 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. peter mancini : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
and the count having been taken : 
the deputy speaker : 
i see a quorum . 
mr. david chatters ( athabasca , canadian alliance ) : 
there is something really rotten about this whole deal . 
those questions have to be answered . 
all of those questions have to be asked . 
there is that whole issue . 
i found the suggestion by the member for broadview-greenwood interesting . 
that was really interesting and really made a lot of sense . 
why did the government do these things ? 
that is not an efficient operation . 
someone has to answer for those things . 
we have to have a committee . 
that has to be a *UNK* deal . 
i do not know how he possibly could do that . 
i do not really care which committee it goes to . 
i hope the government will allow us to do that . 
mr. alex shepherd ( durham , lib. ) : 
some may wonder why i am interested in this issue . 
indeed that is not the intention . 
this seems to be the essence of the problem . 
in fact there are jobs to go to . 
the government has been generous . 
in my opinion these comments are terribly inconsistent . 
what about knowledge based industries ? 
what about *UNK* finished components in north sydney ? 
the list goes on and on . 
the list goes on . 
in fact the people of cape breton have changed their economy . 
they went back in history . 
certainly it was not without some *UNK* . 
i would be the first to admit that . 
economies change and they change with the times . 
the people of cape breton are up to that change . 
it is time to move on . 
it is time for a new future . 
mr. svend j. robinson ( burnaby-douglas , ndp ) : 
this is becoming a habit with the government . 
it is absolutely shameful . 
there is currently an arbitration process under way . 
this is not a debate about figures or statistics . 
yet the liberals insist on just *UNK* ahead . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is there unanimous consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
mr. réal ménard ( hochelaga-maisonneuve , bq ) : 
i have seen the figures on this . 
i am told that it was a really major industry . 
this is where our parliamentary responsibility calls out to us . 
let us not *UNK* words , it is imposing gag orders . 
this is unacceptable . 
what do we want done ? 
mr. pierre de savoye : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
and the count having been taken : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
call in the members . 
and the bells having rung : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
we have quorum . 
i can see their heads shaking . 
it has to be embarrassing . 
we are going to bring coal from *UNK* to cape breton . 
guess whose ships are going to be *UNK* that coal . 
does he select canada ' s shipyards to build ships ? 
that is where he is building his ships . 
who is going to buy this ? 
they wanted to find ways of raising finances . 
we are in passing *UNK* . 
what does the minister of industry say about it ? 
he is happy . 
he is one happy *UNK* . 
it is time to take canada back . 
this does not make sense . 
it is a sad *UNK* . 
as a matter of fact i was there recently . 
they are working hard . 
they have been *UNK* on the coal *UNK* . 
we are not talking about *UNK* jobs . 
we are probably talking about 5,000 jobs . 
we have got a great idea . 
we are talking about men and women who work hard . 
we have to deal with this in committee . 
our banks are *UNK* with money . 
we have *UNK* and trained individuals . 
this country has the best minds . 
they all said the same thing . 
that is definitely not the case . 
we have to *UNK* that . 
eight thousand dollars is a bit of an embarrassment . 
cape *UNK* do not get a fair deal . 
why is this ? 
there are lots of questions . 
that would be the *UNK* day . 
mr. darrel stinson : 
what are we doing today ? 
we are talking about exactly that . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
order , please . 
mr. darrel stinson : 
mr. speaker , but not on the subamendment . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
but not on the *UNK* amendment . 
mr. darrel stinson : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
ms. wendy lill ( dartmouth , ndp ) : 
they took control of the mine . 
together they took control of the mine . 
i do not blame them . 
the liberals seem *UNK* on destroying cape breton island . 
maybe i should be a little more charitable . 
i call it arrogant and *UNK* . 
an hon. member : 
black . 
ms. wendy lill : 
a black comedy , absolutely . 
then a problem *UNK* . 
what is the result ? 
this is no real choice at all . 
it is *UNK* . 
it is cruel , cynical and *UNK* . 
mr. monte solberg ( medicine hat , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
that ' s nothing to be proud of . 
mr. monte solberg : 
what does closure mean ? 
it means that the government is cutting off debate . 
this is an important issue . 
there will be almost *UNK* families affected by this legislation . 
let us consider bill c-20 , the clarity legislation . 
they should be absolutely ashamed . 
this is anti-democratic behaviour . 
i will now move on to more specifics in bill c-11 . 
cape *UNK* are wonderful and *UNK* people . 
they live in a beautiful part of the world . 
it was to build a sustainable industry in cape breton . 
obviously , that has not happen . 
it is now gone . 
who pays the price for that ? 
it lies in the private sector . 
what are those things ? 
cape breton is a beautiful and *UNK* part of the world . 
how do we do that ? 
we do that in a number of ways . 
first , let us clean up the mess at devco . 
let us treat them *UNK* and put this issue behind us . 
how do we do that ? 
we begin by lowering taxes for one thing . 
i am not saying that is the only thing . 
sadly , that has happened at the provincial level . 
that is crazy and it has to end . 
we are not in the 20th century any more . 
these people need to be well trained . 
the people are great and have a unique culture . 
i believe it can . 
cape breton has the tools to do the job . 
it has not . 
mr. yvon godin ( acadie-bathurst , ndp ) : 
only opposition members are talking about it . 
the liberals let them down . 
it is not just devco . 
the liberals are letting the people of atlantic canada down . 
the government offered *UNK* for training . 
jobs do not grow on trees . 
the people of cape breton deserve more respect . 
the miners of cape breton deserve more respect . 
they have put their health and their life on the line . 
they have sacrificed their health for this country . 
but once in office , the liberals gutted employment insurance . 
this is what the liberals have done . 
they followed in brian mulroney ' s *UNK* . 
shame on them . 
this is an all time record . 
an hon. member : 
what is the difference ? 
mr. yvon godin : 
there is no difference . 
that is not what he said . 
that is not what they said . 
now they are saying that the atlantic is for sale . 
i have a surprise for them . 
let us catch the wave ' ' . 
the government dropped them , that is what it did . 
the bill will not change that requirement . 
let me remind my colleagues of two points . 
bill c-11 is relatively simple and straightforward . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is there unanimous consent ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
where do such ideas come from ? 
but what do i know ? 
i do not get paid to *UNK* . 
the men took it and came back for more . 
they did it to get a paycheque and earn their way . 
they served us all well . 
they never , ever got something for nothing . 
miners were not that lucky . 
do not add the *UNK* of insult to injury . 
we earned everything we ever got . 
it should forever be enough to earn us respect . 
ms. alexa mcdonough ( halifax , ndp ) : 
on friday i was in windsor , ontario . 
what he described is absolutely true . 
let us refer this issue to the human resources committee . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
the question is on the amendment to the amendment . 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

questions on the order paper 
the deputy speaker : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
government orders 
canadian tourism commission act 
the deputy speaker : 
mr. réal ménard ( hochelaga-maisonneuve , bq ) : 
we benefited from the presence of the olympic *UNK* . 
of course there is also the old montreal . 
that is a very important tourism centre . 
the olympic *UNK* is located on *UNK* street . 
why do i talk about that ? 
the *UNK* *UNK* brought us the wonderful *UNK* . 
mr. jean-paul marchand ( québec east , bq ) : 
we have considerable *UNK* . 
these actions were successful . 
i must say that *UNK* québec has consolidated the efforts . 
why bother an agency that is working well ? 
that is all this commission is . 
it is unbelievable . 
for instance , what does *UNK* canada do ? 
the list goes on and on . 
the amounts are huge . 
there is also operation unity . 
mr. dennis j. mills ( broadview-greenwood , lib. ) : 
it is an instrument that *UNK* us all together . 
it would work against the separatist ideology . 
*UNK* to the new canada ' ' . 
it was a benefit to every part of our country . 
this would do a number of things . 
mr. richard marceau ( charlesbourg , bq ) : 
tourism can be seen from different *UNK* . 
the federal riding of charlesbourg is exceptional for tourism . 
mr. bernard bigras ( rosemont , bq ) : 
*UNK* is now an important tourist *UNK* . 
the bill is rather odd . 
i worked there for a few years . 
this is important . 
that is the role of *UNK* québec . 
*UNK* québec has a very clear mandate . 
the commission ' s goal also *UNK* me . 
that also *UNK* me . 
why fix what is working in quebec ? 
tourism in quebec is doing well . 
the deputy speaker : 
is the house ready for the question ? 
some hon. members : 
question . 
the deputy speaker : 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
the deputy speaker : 
some hon. members : 
yea . 
the deputy speaker : 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
some hon. members : 
nay . 
the deputy speaker : 
in my opinion the nays have it . 
and more than five members having risen : 
the deputy speaker : 
call in the members . 
and the bells having rung : 
the deputy speaker : 
* * * 
this bill does just that . 
mr. ken epp ( elk island , canadian alliance ) : 
it is called budget day . 
that is the big picture of the budget . 
in other words , what he says is then law . 
we have new rules imposed on canadians without any real input . 
we thought that was an important first step . 
that is how it starts . 
and then we have this *UNK* phrase : 
that is how this thing starts but then it becomes convoluted . 
it states : 
it further states : 
mr. speaker , do you know what i said ? 
do you understand what i just read ? 
i *UNK* them to read it . 
i would like to meet that person . 
that is only one example . 
it goes on and on . 
these are really strange things . 
it goes on and on for four or five pages . 
*UNK* *UNK* ( 13 ) 
that is over 10 years ago . 
they are *UNK* right out of it . 
however , i think of all those other liberals . 
should i call them the green *UNK* liberals over there ? 
it will be gone ' ' . 
they paid again . 
they paid for the election campaign . 
the point i making is this . 
the gst is a very much *UNK* tax . 
i would like to share this with hon. members . 
we recently had a funeral in our family . 
however , there are some *UNK* . 
the gst is everywhere . 
it loves the revenue . 
here is an interesting one . 
i want to say a bit about the tax on *UNK* . 
i think that is something the government should think about . 
i would ask for that . 
sure , why not ? 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
mr. ken epp : 
mr. speaker , i am surprised . 
i am really surprised . 
they ran on that election promise . 
it is *UNK* of the things the government does . 
canadians felt so good about that . 
that is the *UNK* the liberals do . 
why did it not do that ? 
but they did not . 
the liberals ' mandate ends in the next year or two . 
it has not happened . 
mr. yvan loubier ( saint-hyacinthe-bagot , bq ) : 
we will wait *UNK* next year ' ' . 
they said that they had to be re-elected . 
he had told us in this house *UNK* . 
but no . 
why did we say that ? 
the prime minister ' s *UNK* is *UNK* . 
he wanted to leave his mark . 
the *UNK* lasted several months . 
they have been *UNK* down . 
they have been *UNK* down like criminals . 
we will never do that . 
why such a severe judgment once again ? 
why ? 
he could have corrected this injustice . 
let me explain . 
he did not do *UNK* why ? 
this does not make any sense . 
yes , but what exactly are these tax cuts ? 
this is what we have to look at . 
is this normal ? 
it was not his talent or intelligence . 
no one is to be congratulated on these three budgets . 
we certainly do not have to support them . 
i wonder how they manage . 
*UNK* , this is a political decision . 
in short , there were all sorts of good reasons . 
how did the government of quebec do that ? 
taxes on the profits of these businesses had to be *UNK* . 
this is where the fundamental difference lies . 
this led to another problem . 
we cannot . 
we have good reasons for doing so . 
this is unfair . 
the minimum taxation levels are unfair . 
the government of quebec did an excellent job in this area . 
the federal *UNK* is *UNK* . 
mr. scott brison ( kings-hants , pc ) : 
the *UNK* magazine went on to list them . 
i think that is a sad state of affairs . 
these measures were announced on march 20 , 1997 . 
some of them are positive . 
canada needs to *UNK* its middle class . 
economic performance is more important than economic *UNK* . 
we have to get our fundamentals right . 
mr. ghislain lebel ( chambly , bq ) : 
like him , i am worried . 
this is another given . 
that was the last , as far as i recall . 
i do not know what . 
it must not come to that . 
i cannot imagine anything other than what we have now . 
i am open to his comments . 
mr. scott brison : 
he has raised a couple of very important issues . 
it is clear that we do need some level of reform . 
the gst was a significant change as well . 
there was a consensus on the gst . 
i can point to a few examples . 
there are examples closer to home . 
the public debt had increased significantly . 
mr. scott brison : 
mr. speaker , i thank the hon. member for his question . 
that was indeed a *UNK* question . 
mr. pat martin ( winnipeg centre , ndp ) : 
that should not give canadians any comfort . 
it says : 
that is a myth that has been *UNK* . 
frankly , ordinary working canadians are used to being *UNK* on . 
that would be a laudable pursuit . 
that would be a laudable concept . 
that is not a priority . 
we have not heard it expressed here . 
it is an *UNK* body . 
the ndp caucus rejects the committee ' s *UNK* approach . 
it will make that *UNK* even *UNK* . 
we have a surplus budget situation . 
i do not think so . 
the employment insurance system is broken . 
it is completely *UNK* . 
what kind of an insurance fund is that ? 
you would think you had been *UNK* . 
you would be outraged . 
in fact , the figures are worse than that . 
at the very worst it is *UNK* . 
tonight there will be a vote on this issue . 
it came out of the pockets of working people . 
we are very concerned about it . 
i want to voice our strong opposition to bill c-24 . 
the member talks about tax relief for rich or wealthy canadians . 
the facts do not support that . 
mr. pat martin : 
the ei fund was in deficit . 
all the money goes into general revenues . 
i do . 
who is this benefiting the most ? 
obviously the high income *UNK* . 
she pays $600 per *UNK* in taxes every year . 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
it should be corrected . 
mr. pat martin : 
they have to pay into it . 
they have no choice . 
that is fundamentally wrong . 
the hon. member is right . 
it *UNK* to become an insurance program . 
mr. peter mancini ( sydney-victoria , ndp ) : 
mr. pat martin : 
productivity is not the issue . 
it is misleading and i would say *UNK* dishonest . 
mr. eric lowther ( calgary centre , canadian alliance ) : 
it was mentioned by the previous speaker . 
they voted often on that basis . 
the gst is a good example .

mr. david price ( compton-stanstead , pc ) : 
mr. speaker , that is strange . 
these diseases have been kind of forgotten by canadians . 
therefore they are not being *UNK* for them . 
what exactly has been done to protect them in theatre ? 
full medical services are provided for them . 
mr. art hanger ( calgary northeast , canadian alliance ) : 
the short answer is yes , mr. speaker . 
this report raises some disturbing incidents .

i would like to hear what the point of order is . 
mr. michel bellehumeur : 
the speaker : 
all the members will hear the same response . 
government orders 
sales tax and excise tax amendments act , 1999 
mr. richard marceau ( charlesbourg , bq ) : 
i salute him . 
what is the result of these cuts ? 
the result is that the provinces are feeling the crunch . 
we could go on like this in several areas . 
this is serious . 
unfortunately for them , they have been bought off . 
that is what has happened . 
this aid represents *UNK* per *UNK* . 
this is not what quebec is asking . 
it was reasonable and it was right . 
that quorum should be made up of liberal members . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
and the count having been taken : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
we do not have quorum . 
call in the members . 
and the bells having rung : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
we now have quorum . 
mr. ted white ( north vancouver , canadian alliance ) : 
an hon. member : 
stand up . 
mr. ted white : 
somebody is calling *UNK* up ' ' . 
listen to them calling things like that . 
they really need to *UNK* their approach entirely . 
this is a place of the parties . 
mr. john bryden : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the pot should not call the *UNK* black . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
what a *UNK* group we are today . 
mr. ted white : 
they are not true debates . 
we know that . 
it also increases the excise tax on *UNK* . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
i am sorry but i need to interrupt the member . 
mr. ted white : 
is it that the rcmp are *UNK* ? 
one of the questions had to do with cigarette taxes . 
it actually has to spend it on education . 
let us look at *UNK* *UNK* . 
that passed by *UNK* . 
he is still supporting it after all these years . 
it is about canada ' s debt . 
the title on it is *UNK* ' 89 ' ' . 
that was 11 years ago . 
here is the real *UNK* . 
the debt continued to *UNK* . 
it also *UNK* under this government . 
we could probably build 100 brand new ones . 
it is all because of this terrible debt . 
because of that our social programs are under stress . 
it is almost hypocrisy what goes on here with the attacks . 
it is the taxpayer who pays . 
certainly i will be voting against bill c-24 . 
mr. john bryden ( wentworth-burlington , lib. ) : 
the member is perfectly correct . 
the americans love referenda . 
mr. ted white : 
we would rather it just went away . 
but the people of california have every opportunity to reverse that . 
i believe that is roughly the right figure . 
what do the citizens of canada get out of that ? 
that is what happens from this place . 
mr. john bryden : 
i am not referring to him as a *UNK* . 
i am not *UNK* his remarks . 
it led to terrible results . 
it was *UNK* in *UNK* *UNK* . 
i think we have advanced beyond that . 
we cannot do that by referenda . 
mr. ted white : 
he keeps *UNK* back to history . 
he even went back as far as the *UNK* this time . 
we live in a totally different era . 
he mentions that some of the people are poorly informed . 
i will give him an example . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is the house ready for the question ? 
some hon. members : 
question . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion ?

immigration and refugee protection act 
mr. jean dubé ( madawaska-restigouche , pc ) : 
i have my doubts . 
this is hardly a surprise . 
when danger *UNK* , we took action . 
perhaps the minister could clarify ``a representative ' ' . 
why these numbers ? 
what does she mean by serious criminality ? 
where are they ? 
how many criminals are passing through ? 
how many are there and where are they ? 
mr. bill matthews : 
what is the hon. member talking about ? 
potential criminals ? 
mr. jean dubé : 
the recommendation passed *UNK* at committee . 
it is unbelievable . 
it must be law . 
allow me to explain these serious issues . 
what new diseases are *UNK* *UNK* to canada ? 
the auditor general also addressed the department ' s computer systems . 
simply put , the systems are inadequate . 
mr. john mckay : 
have you read this speech ? 
mr. jean dubé : 
the systems are outdated and are not integrated . 
this new funding will be *UNK* up very quickly . 
that is not all . 
what kinds of people are *UNK* coming to this country ? 
this party supports parts of the bill . 
mr. reed elley ( nanaimo-cowichan , canadian alliance ) : 
let us be realistic for a moment . 
they are seldom caught and rarely convicted for their crimes . 
it simply will not happen . 
they made a horrendous journey under appalling conditions . 
the future does not look any brighter . 
unfortunately all i can see is more disappointing news . 
to them the situation was very clear . 
are we not then creating a double standard ? 
this issue has been ongoing for far too long . 
canada ' s citizens demand to be safe from undue risks . 
offers of bonds have been made and rejected . 
we ask the question why . 
mrs. *UNK* *UNK* had six children . 
does this sound like an unreasonable request ? 
it certainly does not to me . 
yet the answer was certainly unreasonable . 
*UNK* there is a somewhat *UNK* *UNK* to this story . 
imagine what those nine days must have been like . 
what a horrifying thought , what a tragic thing . 
i must raise the question of regulations again . 
this is not new . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. rob anders ( calgary west , canadian alliance ) : 
i would like the hon. member to address that . 
mr. reed elley : 
the *UNK* are getting less *UNK* on the coast . 
we will have to see what happens . 
mr. rob anders : 
mr. reed elley : 
mr. ted white ( north vancouver , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. reed elley : 
how do they get in ? 
mr. rob anders : 
mr. reed elley : 
mr. réal ménard ( hochelaga-maisonneuve , bq ) : 
this is a considerable effort . 
she planned to have a child . 
their number is between *UNK* and 250,000 . 
there is reason to fear for their *UNK* security . 
these cases are in the category of *UNK* . 
this is the family *UNK* category . 
there is also a more economic type of immigration . 
i have *UNK* memories of those days . 
this is a positive goal . 
the government deserves our congratulations for this . 
why ? 
well , here i go . 
however , i repeat , the bill is far from complete . 
i will come back to this point at a later time . 
the question of *UNK* young people is a problem for us .

it creates horror stories . 
let us talk about *UNK* . 
do they know about immigration rules ? 
this is happening in my own riding . 
an hon. member : 
our *UNK* are better *UNK* . 
mr. deepak obhrai : 
my colleague is absolutely right . 
yes , they are experts . 
they could become immigration *UNK* and do a better job . 
who takes advantage of those loopholes ? 
we all know that . 
no , they would not . 
let us talk about spousal applications . 
i am saying that it does not take six months . 
everything takes time , time , time . 
the minister of immigration says she will bring in 300,000 people . 
we are only at *UNK* because there are no resources . 
people fall through the cracks . 
any immigration officer will tell us that . 
i have visited new *UNK* . 
there is an inconsistency . 
let us talk about *UNK* *UNK* . 
naturally they have ties outside the country . 
there is nothing wrong with that . 
we cannot trust him to go back . 
where did the problem *UNK* ? 
the problem *UNK* here . 
we allow them to stay here . 
where did the problem *UNK* ? 
the problem *UNK* here . 
why is there not a faster process ? 
we are proud of that tradition . 
there is nothing wrong with that tradition . 
that is not the problem . 
his wife and child are overseas . 
his wife suffered a heart attack . 
why can we not have a faster process ? 
it is amazing . 
there is no consistency . 
it could take six or eight months . 
we have started to hire local officers . 
that is because the government cut the funding . 
they are local personnel . 
what is canada ' s desire ? 
i have *UNK* local immigration officers . 
these people do not understand . 
the delays are becoming more and more common . 
they do it and they do it fast . 
they are in the country . 
what was the reason behind those calls ? 
that our laws were being abused . 
have we tightened up the law ? 
have we even improved it ? 
i do not think anything has been improved . 
canadians are *UNK* . 
there needs to be sincerity . 
has the bill cleaned up anything ? 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
my colleague brought up the issue of visitors *UNK* . 
mr. deepak obhrai : 
he is absolutely right . 
this is where the danger lies . 
are they going to deny entry to more people ? 
my colleague is absolutely right . 
mr. chuck cadman ( surrey north , canadian alliance ) : 
mr. deepak obhrai : 
that is not the most important issue . 
the more important issue is the process in canada . 
the deputy speaker : 
private members ' business 
employment insurance 
mr. peter mancini ( sydney-victoria , ndp ) : 
the motion reads as follows : 
the question would have to be asked : 
the amendment to the motion would make it read as follows : 
we do not need a review . 
there are certain realities in this country . 
we live in a harsh climate . 
it is not the workers who are seasonal . 
i have already commented on that . 
this to me sounds like an election ploy . 
a review can mean anything . 
i do not think it will happen . 
we have been surprised in the house before . 
it says that tourism is the answer . 
that is only natural . 
they pay into an insurance fund . 
mr. reed elley ( nanaimo-cowichan , canadian alliance ) : 
my own riding of nanaimo-cowichan has its share of seasonal workers . 
the forest industry actually is no different . 
indeed , tourism is truly seasonal employment . 
why would they do that , one may ask . 
we may have different solutions however . 
those who are *UNK* *UNK* of ei have their benefits reduced . 
rather , it will *UNK* them . 
i would question what has changed since that time . 
is the data all relevant ? 
they already know that when they begin . 
let us be clear in this debate . 
mr. yvon godin : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
mrs. suzanne tremblay ( rimouski-mitis , bq ) : 
they are *UNK* as seasonal workers . 
simply as follows . 
most of the work which is available is seasonal work . 
it is not a crime to be a *UNK* . 
it is *UNK* with cash . 
their plan proved to be quite effective . 
let us look at the riding of burin-st . 
it is costing them *UNK* million a year . 
these are not numbers to which only *UNK* can relate . 
this money has simply gone from the local scene . 
seasonal work is not a crime . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is that agreed ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
mr. bryon wilfert ( oak ridges , lib. ) : 
i think this is important for everyone . 
we had to make the system fairer . 
there had to be greater incentives to work . 
data for these groups are often very similar . 
this is what we are doing . 
the government certainly will support the amendment . 
mr. yvon godin ( acadie-bathurst , ndp ) : 
this motion specifically *UNK* rural areas in this country . 
this is a huge sum for this rural area . 
mr. jean dubé : 
doug young ' s reform . 
mr. yvon godin : 
let us take the case of the *UNK* at home . 
what message do the liberals want to send to the *UNK* ? 
these are some of the seasonal jobs in the rural regions . 
this has to change . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
the question is on the amendment to the amendment . 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
yea . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
some hon. members : 
nay . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
in my opinion the nays have it . 
and more than five members having risen : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

the next question is on the amendment . 
is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the amendment ? 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

adjournment proceedings 
training 
mr. yvon godin ( acadie-bathurst , ndp ) : 
the issue has become a real problem throughout the country . 
consequently they get into debt . 
the government could exempt them from paying interest . 
it is driving them into debt and continues to do so . 
the poor are falling on hard luck . 
the canada student loans program is also offered by the government . 
at the same time we modernize those programs . 
human resources development 
mr. paul crête ( kamouraska-rivière-du-loup-témiscouata-les basques , bq ) : 
but *UNK* , there were a government inquiry on the issue . 
that is the process . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) :

it is certainly in need of change . 
i start by speaking to the group no. 1 amendments . 
this concern has come up several times before . 
i deal with this concern in my amendment . 
most canadians see that as being reasonable . 
the court did not consider that . 
that is a sad *UNK* . 
this is shameful . 
mr. bernard bigras ( rosemont , bq ) : 
there is something rather odd about that . 
there are , basically , two reasons , three even . 
it was not new . 
it is not new . 
so things had to be *UNK* and negotiations initiated . 
quebec gave negotiations a chance . 
as late as yesterday , the deputy ministers were talking . 
we also proposed the following : 
mr. mac harb ( ottawa centre , lib. ) : 
the member is *UNK* that there is a problem . 
their children require citizenship in those countries . 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
there are problems . 
there is nothing new about that . 
she decided to get married . 
they fell in love . 
guess what ? 
they want to get married . 
that happens . 
that ought not to happen . 
there is no reason for that to happen . 
mr. mark muise ( west nova , pc ) : 
we did not like this . 
mr. pierre de savoye ( portneuf , bq ) : 
it has always *UNK* that right . 
this approach is unacceptable . 
mr. art hanger ( calgary northeast , canadian alliance ) : 
the minister is well aware of that particular issue . 
she was aware of the issue when she took office . 
one hospital in particular *UNK* a number of them . 
obviously , she does not want to do that . 
i have a problem with that . 
i will make the reference again . 
the government pointed out that it likes consultations . 
we had consultation after consultation . 
i rest my case . 
the bill before us is inadequate .

the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
in my opinion the yeas have it . 
and more than five members having risen : 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
this group contains motions nos. 4 and 5 . 
mr. art hanger ( calgary northeast , canadian alliance ) : 
we will support motions nos. 4 and 5 . 
it could be changed . 
i think it is a contradiction . 
the point in question is the issue of citizenship . 
it has to be *UNK* . 
i find the whole proposal lacking . 
i was a young boy . 
it is important for canadians to know that . 
think about it . 
what happens is this . 
the cabinet makes an order on revocation . 
this is a good motion . 
we only have to go back to the second world war . 
they were sent back to the gas chambers . 
we have a governor general who is from hong kong . 
the acting speaker ( ms. thibeault ) : 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
he also experienced great danger in coming to canada . 
we have not done that . 
they were all immigrants within the last 10 years . 
they were taking the *UNK* of the *UNK* in society . 
i am not *UNK* . 
the hon. gentleman has presented a very worthy case . 
i want to support him and i want to support this . 
mr. rahim jaffer ( edmonton-strathcona , canadian alliance ) : 
we should not take it lightly . 
i think it is in clause 17 . 
that is unfortunate . 
it is not something that happens very frequently , thank goodness . 
they are being sponsored by the canadian alliance . 
i would like to give my reasons . 
he talked about it as being a paradox and a contradiction . 
let us be clear about what the motions would do . 
mr. leon e. benoit : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
i did it as a *UNK* . 
i want to clarify that for the member . 
the motion did come from the government originally . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
ms. carolyn parrish : 
i wish to go back to my point . 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
i do not understand the logic in that . 
it seems ludicrous if there is a change that makes sense . 
i cannot understand the argument . 
that is unacceptable . 
that is old style . 
that is what the motion is meant to do . 
the member will have to answer to her constituents . 
they seem to be happy with that . 
it is something that no other country offers . 
i really do not understand . 
the citizenship act is very important . 
i encourage the government to reconsider . 
i believe some members will support them . 
these folks have experienced extreme *UNK* in their country . 
they have gone through all the appropriate *UNK* . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
is the house ready for the question . 
some hon. members : 
question . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
agreed . 
some hon. members : 
no . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
some hon. members : 
yea . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
all those opposed will please say nay . 
some hon. members : 
nay . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
in my opinion the nays have it . 
and more than five members having risen : 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
mr. leon e. benoit ( lakeland , canadian alliance ) : 
that is the way the government seems to manage . 
the minister cannot co-ordinate her own time . 
that is completely unacceptable . 
that is unacceptable . 
i do not think that is too much to ask . 
it is unbelievable that would be the case . 
it is an unacceptable process . 
one has to wonder why . 
everyone in this group is a political appointment . 
it is unbelievable . 
it is the same type of thing . 
does that not make sense ? 
that is unacceptable . 
too much is left to regulation . 
i encourage the government to support these motions . 
mr. bernard bigras ( rosemont , bq ) : 
this is a fundamental issue . 
in our opinion , this is fundamental . 
this is fundamental . 
there is no definition . 
*UNK* parents were clear on this issue . 
we wanted these fundamental aspects to be considered .

mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) moved : 
mr. svend j. robinson : 
mr. speaker , i rise on a point of order . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
it is motion no. 69 . 
mr. paul szabo : 
that is the issue , freedom of expression . 
that is a serious issue . 
harm is said to flow from pornography in two ways . 
there are three potential sources of proof available . 
the first is *UNK* evidence . 
it talked a bit about the harm effects . 
the article which is dated may 1999 states : 
pornography is a root of all kinds of evil . 
it is the word *UNK* . 
it states : 
consider what has happened in the past 20 years . 
i do not think so . 
it *UNK* an outrage right across canada . 
here we are back to the fundamentals . 
there has been much written about this case . 
this is a very serious situation . 
i cannot state it any more simply . 
i tend to agree with the justice minister . 
i believe that the notwithstanding clause is for extraordinary circumstances . 
i want it to be dealt with *UNK* . 
i believe i have the support of colleagues in this place . 
mr. john reynolds ( west vancouver-sunshine coast , canadian alliance ) : 
the member ' s motion states , in part : 
in fact , it is more *UNK* of our times . 
i am talking about regina v *UNK* . 
in fact , i would welcome this new definition . 
i do not believe this could happen . 
yes , mr. speaker , a crime *UNK* . 
surely we have moved beyond that thinking . 
we have gotten away from that . 
he was serious . 
he really believed that the supreme court had the final say . 
he is correct . 
perhaps now is the time . 
we know what the majority feel . 
we will support the bill . 
mr. peter mackay ( pictou-antigonish-guysborough , pc ) : 
it would basically *UNK* up an existing definition . 
this issue is of importance . 
we have some very *UNK* judges . 
the government should very much consider *UNK* the particular issue . 
we should be doing more to study this area . 
there is much to be done . 
obviously a lot can be done . 
i support the hon. member in his efforts . 
there is no need therefore to make this change . 
the voluntary code states that : 
the criminal code is a *UNK* instrument . 
mr. roy bailey ( souris-moose mountain , canadian alliance ) : 
it is now before the supreme court of canada . 
canadians from coast to coast are worried about that . 
i cannot believe the defence of the system . 
it simply goes beyond my imagination . 
*UNK* takes place in many different ways . 
let us take freedom of religion . 
the member would be called totally out of order . 
it is even *UNK* into the house . 
we are allowing this in many different ways . 
i congratulate him for bringing this forward . 
they would bring it in tomorrow if they had to . 
this is not a party thing . 
however , here we are in *UNK* . 
we will let the courts decide . 
why would it not grow ? 
it is growing . 
hon. members may think i am carrying some *UNK* . 
we know that people were told what to do . 
in closing , i want to congratulate the hon. member . 
he will stand in defence of children . 
he will stand against child abuse . 
he will stand against pornography . 
this is freedom of expression . 
this is wrong . 
nobody can defend it . 
canadians elect us . 
we should not be passing the buck . 
it is our responsibility to do it in this place . 
there will be no change . 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
he talked about the role of parents . 
we cannot legislate morality . 
this is a very tragic case . 
it is linked to this debate . 
what happened ? 
he is a person for whom there is no recovery . 
he has permanent brain damage . 
they could see it . 
we have an opportunity to be a part of the solution . 
that is why motion no. 69 came forward . 
it has been a constructive debate . 
i thank hon. members for their kind comments . 
we know that the starting point is children . 
we have to look at that seriously . 
if not , maybe we should . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
adjournment proceedings 
parental leave 
mrs. christiane gagnon ( québec , bq ) : 
it would increase from 25 to 50 weeks . 
this group represents quebec organizations . 
why ? 
because 700 hours are now required to qualify . 
this is totally inadequate . 
who will be able to afford it ? 
these benefits are provided to quebecers like all other canadians . 
our priority is to implement our improved parental benefits . 
trade 
mr. paul szabo ( mississauga south , lib. ) : 
i want to wish them a happy birthday . 
we are going to share a dinner . 
it is a fine distinction . 
it states : 
the minister gave some very interesting statistics . 
the acting speaker ( mr. mcclelland ) : 
( the house adjourned at *UNK* p.m. )
