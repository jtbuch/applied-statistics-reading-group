Thursday 's report on the September consumer price index is expected to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9 % gain reported Friday in the producer price index . STOP

Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow . STOP

*CUNK-* *CUNKS* of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion acquisition of Farmers Group Inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates . STOP
The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's *UNKLY* takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers . STOP
In an attempt to *UNK* U.S. regulators ' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers , Sir James in August agreed to sell Farmers to *CUNK* if he is successful in acquiring B.A.T . STOP
As part of the agreement , *CUNK* agreed to invest $ 1 billion in *CUNK* Investments Ltd. , Sir James 's acquisition vehicle . STOP
Of the total $ 5.5 billion to be paid to *CUNK* by *CUNK* , about $ 1 billion will come from available resources of *CUNK* 's parent , *CUNK-* Group , $ 2.25 billion will be in the form of notes issued by *CUNK* , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion will be in long-term bank loans . STOP
In an interview Thursday , *CUNK* *CUNK* , chairman and chief executive officer of *CUNK* , said his group has already obtained *UNKS* from a group of banks led by Cie . Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing . STOP
The other banking companies in the group are Credit *CUNKS* , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , he said . STOP
Mr. *CUNK* said *CUNK-* Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of *UNK-* assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition . STOP
He said the assets to be sold would be `` *UNK-* '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers . STOP
`` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said . STOP
The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , *CUNK* has an *UNK* obligation to sell Farmers to *CUNK* upon an acquisition of B.A.T . STOP
`` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate *CUNK* , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because *CUNK* wo n't be an owner of Farmers at *UNK* , '' Mr. *CUNK* said . STOP
Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance *UNKS* in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are *UNKED* . STOP
The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between *CUNK* and *CUNK* , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition . STOP
*CUNK* dropped its initial # *UNKN* billion -LRB- $ *UNKN* billion -RRB- takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the *UNKED* sale of Farmers to *CUNK* receives regulatory approval . STOP
A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing *UNK* has changed . STOP
The new financing structure is still a *UNKLY* leveraged one , and *CUNK* still plans to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt . '' STOP
That dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T , the spokesman added . STOP
`` It would have severe implications for Farmers ' policy holders . '' STOP
To fend off Sir James 's advances , B.A.T has proposed a sweeping restructuring that would *UNK* it to a tobacco and financial services concern . STOP
*CUNKAL* sales at General Motors Corp. *UNKED* the U.S. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early October , the first sales period of the 1990 model year . STOP

*CUNKLY* built truck sales were down 10.4 % to *UNKN* *UNKS* , *UNKS* and sport utility vehicles . STOP
The heavy use of incentives to clear out 1989 models appears to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which began officially Oct. 1 . STOP
This appears particularly true at GM , which had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall *UNKN* % from last year 's unusually high level . STOP
Overall , sales of all *UNK-* vehicles fell *UNKN* % from a year ago . STOP
Without GM , overall sales for the other U.S. *UNKS* were roughly flat with 1989 results . STOP

All of the GM divisions except *CUNK* showed big declines . STOP
*CUNK* posted a *UNKN* % increase despite new competition from Lexus , the *UNKING* luxury-car division of Toyota Motor Corp . STOP
Lexus sales were n't available ; the cars are imported and Toyota reports their sales only at *UNK-* . STOP
The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered in addition to consumer *UNKS* and *UNKEST* financing , a company spokesman said . STOP
Last year , GM had a different program in place that continued *UNKING* dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold . STOP
Aside from GM , other car makers posted generally mixed results . STOP
Ford Motor Co. had a 1.8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4 % increase in domestic truck sales . STOP
Chrysler Corp. had a 7.5 % drop in car sales , *UNKING* its generally slow performance all year . STOP
However , sales of trucks , including the company 's popular *UNKS* , rose 4.3 % . STOP
Honda Motor Co. 's sales of *UNKLY* built vehicles plunged *UNKN* % from a year earlier . STOP
Honda 's plant in *CUNK* , Ohio , was *UNKING* up to build 1990 model *CUNKS* , a Honda spokesman said . STOP
`` We 're really confident everything will *UNK* back to normal , '' he added . STOP
Separately , Chrysler said firm prices on its *UNK-* domestic cars and *UNKS* will rise an average of 5 % over *UNKLY* *UNKED* 1989 models . STOP
*CUNK* prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced earlier this fall . STOP

In addition , competition for *UNKS* is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was *UNKLY* controlled . STOP

It proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission to set up office . STOP
Not only did the *CUNK* Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more *UNKING* : `` They found us four phone lines in central *CUNKEST* , '' says *CUNK* *CUNKS* , a Radio Free Europe *UNK* who helped *UNK* the *CUNKEST* location .

`` That is a *UNK* . '' STOP
It 's a far *UNK* from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome *UNKING* of its *UNKS* and *UNKION* of local *UNKS* -LRB- who filed reports to the network by phone , secret *UNKS* or letters -RRB- . STOP
In fact , some of the network 's *CUNK* *UNKS* say they *UNK* Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the `` *CUNK* *CUNKS* of the *UNK* *CUNK* . '' STOP

It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss Hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs . STOP
Those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on Sunday morning for `` Sunday Journal , '' on *CUNK* Radio . STOP
The competitive spirit is clearly *UNKING* Radio Free Europe , which is trying to beef up programs . STOP

The disease *UNK* comes to mind , of course , not as an *UNKION* on the advocates of national service . STOP
Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing *UNKS* of a *UNK* idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s , along with *UNK* . STOP

If only we could get America 's *UNK* youth into at least a *UNK* uniform we might be able to *UNK* *UNK-* again and revive the spirit of giving . STOP
A quarter of a century ago national service was *UNKED* as a way of *UNKING* the *UNKEST* *UNKS* of the *UNK* -- by , of all things , expanding the *UNK* . STOP
Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many *UNK-* *UNKS* , despite their protests that present plans contain no *UNKION* . STOP
*CUNK* of the *UNKER* military in the 1970s seemed to *UNK* national service as much as the *UNK* . STOP
But the virus was kept alive in *UNK* departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let loose . STOP
This time it attempted to *UNK* two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans . STOP
Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates *UNKED* , but require some form of service from each *UNK* ? STOP
*CUNK* service , *UNKER* , could be a *UNK-* option . STOP
Thus , *UNKLY* it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove *OUS* , *UNKING* *UNK* conservatives , *UNK-* *UNKS* , and *UNK* *UNKS* . STOP
The Democratic *CUNK* Council , a *UNK* group *UNKING* the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents . STOP
A provision allowing grants to be applied to *UNK-* purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of *UNKING* . STOP
The *CUNK* plan *UNKED* `` *UNKS* '' *UNKING* trees , *UNKING* *UNKS* , *UNKING* children , and *UNKING* *UNKS* for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care . STOP
With a tax-free $ 10,000 *UNKER* payment at the end of each year , the *UNKS* would be making a wage comparable to $ *UNKN* a year . STOP
*CUNK* you , most of `` the *UNKS* '' would be *UNKED* 17 - to *UNKS* , some not even high school *UNKS* , and many saving money by living at home . STOP
They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families . STOP
As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the *UNK-* *UNKS* decided to abandon the *UNKLY* crucial principle of `` give in order to get . '' STOP
*CUNKION* to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own *UNK* process , also led to the *UNK-* option being dropped . STOP
Clearly , a new *UNK* for national service had to be *UNKED* up . STOP
What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great *UNK* of government *UNK* , where many a *UNK* *UNK* of *UNK* is kept on the back *UNKER* until it can be brought forward and presented as *UNK* *UNK* ? STOP
In this case , the new *UNK* for national service called for throwing many *UNKED* legislative *UNKS* into one *UNK* : a *UNKION* project for educational aid -LRB- particularly *UNKING* to the *CUNK* and Sen. Sam *CUNK* -RRB- , a similar *UNKION* program for youth *UNKION* -LRB- a la Sen. *CUNKS* *CUNK* -RRB- , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior *UNK* *UNKER* projects -LRB- a Kennedy specialty -RRB- , a community service *UNK-* program for students -LRB- *UNKING* to the *UNK* of Sen. *CUNK* *CUNKS* , among others -RRB- , plus *UNK* of the *CUNK* *UNKER* program and the *CUNKED* *CUNK* *CUNKER* , Foster *CUNK* , and *CUNK* *CUNKION* programs .

Before the *UNK* is *UNKED* , the House may add more *UNKS* , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ *UNKN* million . STOP
It is widely known that `` too many *UNKS* *UNK* the *UNK* , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the *UNKS* , especially if they are senators . STOP
The `` *UNKS* '' bill coming out of Congress may be *UNUNK* *UNK* , but the *UNKED* *UNKS* are happy and the restaurant is pushing the *UNK* very hard . STOP
The *UNK* of *UNK* is in the air . STOP
Is the *UNK* sector so weak that it needs such *UNKED* assistance ? STOP
On the contrary , it is as robust as ever . STOP
According to the *CUNK* *CUNK* , American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30 % -LRB- adjusted for inflation -RRB- . STOP
Even if government does see various `` *UNUNK* needs , '' national service is not the way to meet them . STOP
If we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more *UNKS* based on something called `` *UNK* , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service . '' STOP
Or we might provide a tax credit for working students . STOP
What we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a *CUNK* Bill . STOP
To the extent we lack *UNKER* to staff *UNKAL* jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue *UNKING* technology , or allow more legal *UNKION* , rather than *UNK* high school *UNKS* as short-term workers and cause *UNK* among permanent workers paid *UNKER* amounts to do the same jobs . STOP
Will national service , in the current highly *UNKED* and *UNK* form *UNK* enough appeal to get adopted ? STOP
Not necessarily . STOP
*CUNKS* show wide , *UNKED* support for some *UNK* concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any *UNK* public backing . STOP
Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are *UNKING* a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` *UNKS* '' and `` *UNKS* , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` *UNKS* . '' STOP
So far , the president seems *UNKED* to substitute any of the *UNKS* for his own *UNKING* proposal to *UNK* a `` *CUNKS* of *CUNK* '' foundation with $ 25 million to *UNK* citizens of all *UNKS* and *UNK* them to genuine *UNK* . STOP
However , even this *UNK* plan could become *UNK* if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the *UNK* of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` *UNKING* '' federal funds for *UNKER* projects . STOP
There 's no need for such concessions . STOP
The *UNKS* can be defeated , the virus controlled , and real service protected . STOP
National service , the *UNK* idea , still wo n't go away then , of course , but the millions of *UNKED* youth performing works of `` *UNK* content '' will be *UNKED* only in the *UNKION* of their *UNKS* . STOP
Mr. *CUNK* is a fellow at the *CUNKED* Hudson Institute . STOP

He succeeds his father , Philip T. *CUNKER* , who founded the company and remains chairman . STOP
Robert E. *CUNKS* III , 39 , who headed the company 's Philadelphia region , was appointed president and chief operating officer , succeeding Gary *CUNKER* . STOP
American *CUNKS* Service Group Inc. said it purchased about 42 % of Prime Medical Services Inc. for about $ 5 million from Texas American Energy Corp . STOP
American *CUNKS* said it also replaced four Texas American representatives on Prime 's *UNKER* board . STOP
American provides a variety of financial services to doctors and hospitals . STOP
Prime , based in *CUNKER* , N.J. , provides management services to *UNK* *UNKION* *UNKS* and *UNK* *UNKING* centers . STOP
For the year ended June 30 , Prime had a net loss of $ 3 million on sales of $ 13.8 million . STOP
The inflation-adjusted growth rate for France 's gross domestic product for the second quarter was revised upward to *UNKN* % from the previous three months from the initial estimate of 0.7 % , the National Statistics Institute said . STOP
The state agency said the latest *UNKION* left the growth rate for the *UNKER* compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % . STOP
If the economy continues to expand by *UNKN* % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave *CUNK* growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute said . STOP
That would be down from the 3.8 % rise posted in 1988 . STOP
The Canadian government announced a new , 12-year Canada Savings Bond issue that will yield investors 10.5 % in the first year . STOP
The annual interest rate for each of the next 11 years will be set each fall , when details of a new series are released . STOP
Canada Savings Bonds are major government instruments for meeting its financial requirements . STOP
The government has about *UNKN* billion Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ *UNKN* billion -RRB- of such bonds currently outstanding . STOP
Only Canadian residents are permitted to buy Canada Savings Bonds , which may be *UNKED* any time at face value . STOP
The bonds go on sale Oct. 19 . STOP
The debate over National Service has begun again . STOP
After a decade in which more than 50 *UNKS* established their own service or *UNKION* *UNKS* and dozens of school systems made community service a *UNK* to *UNK-* *UNKION* , the focus has *UNKED* to Washington . STOP
At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring . STOP
One , *UNKED* by Sen. Sam *CUNK* -LRB- D. , *CUNK* . -RRB- and Rep. Dave *CUNK* -LRB- D. , *CUNK* -RRB- , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served . STOP
An *UNKS* bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , and including some diluted *CUNK-* provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic *CUNK* *CUNK* *CUNK* , Barbara *CUNK* and Christopher *CUNK* , has been reported out of the Senate Labor Committee . STOP
It might well win Senate passage . STOP
President Bush has *UNKED* his own *CUNK* *CUNKING* Service -LRB- *CUNK* -RRB- plan , though its details remain to be specified . STOP
What is one to think of all this ? STOP
*CUNK* and special interests *UNK* some responses . STOP
People eager to have youth `` pay their *UNKS* to society '' favor service proposals -- *UNKLY* mandatory ones . STOP
So do those who seek a `` *UNKED* concept of *UNK* , '' a concept imposing *UNK* obligations as well as *UNKING* rights . STOP
Then there are *UNK* opponents . STOP
To *UNKS* , mandatory service is an *UNKION* and *UNK* systems are *UNK* uses of tax money . STOP
*CUNKS* of the market question the value of the work national service would perform : STOP
If the market wo n't pay for it , they argue , it ca n't be worth its cost . STOP
*CUNKS* of the left are also *UNKLY* opposed ; they see service as a cover for the *UNK* , or fear the *UNKION* of youth , or want to see rights *UNKED* , not obligations . STOP
But what about those of us whose views are not *UNKED* by formula or *UNK* ? STOP
How should we think about national service ? STOP
Let 's begin by *UNKING* a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning . STOP
*CUNK* service be *UNK* or *UNK* ? STOP
Short or long ? STOP
*CUNK-* or *UNK-* ? STOP
*CUNK* or *UNUNK* ? STOP
*CUNK* participants live at home and work nearby or live in *UNKS* and work on public *UNKS* ? STOP
What kinds of work would they do ? STOP
What does `` national '' mean ? STOP
*CUNK* the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private *UNK* organizations ? STOP
And who would serve ? STOP
Only *UNKS* , as with the *UNK* , or both *UNKS* ? STOP
*CUNK* only or all *UNKS* ? STOP
*CUNKS* people , or poor people , or a genuine *UNKION* ? STOP
Many or few ? STOP
Those are not *UNKAL* questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them . STOP
Then how should we think about national service ? STOP
As a starting point , here are five *UNKS* : 1 . Consider the *UNKS* , not the name . STOP
*CUNK* `` national service '' in the *UNK* ; consider specific proposals . STOP
They will *UNKER* in crucial ways . STOP
2 . `` Service '' should be service . STOP
As *UNKLY* understood , service implies *UNK* . STOP
It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or *UNKING* a career . STOP
It follows that proposals like *CUNK-* , whose benefits to *UNKS* are worth some $ *UNKN* a year , do not qualify . STOP
There is a *UNK* for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a *CUNK* Bill without the *CUNK* '' ; *UNKLY* those benefits should be earned , not given . STOP
But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young *UNK-* *UNKS* with *UNK-* jobs . STOP
Why call that service ? STOP
3 . *CUNK* is fine ; *UNKION* is not . STOP
*CUNKED* service is *UNUNK* . STOP
It is also *UNUNK* and *UNUNK* . STOP
-LRB- Who will throw several hundred thousand *UNKS* in jail each year ? -RRB- STOP
But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government *UNKS* many kinds of behavior . STOP
It should also encourage service -- *UNKLY* by all classes and all *UNKS* . STOP
Its *UNK* should strengthen and not *UNUNK* the strong tradition of *UNKING* in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local *UNKS* about which tasks most need doing . STOP
4 . *CUNK* programs are not cheap . STOP
*CUNKS* assume that national service would get important work done *UNKLY* : forest *UNKS* fought , housing *UNKED* , students *UNKED* , *UNK-* centers *UNKED* . STOP
There is important work to be done , and existing service and *UNKION* *UNKS* have shown that even *UNKS* who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not *UNKLY* . STOP
*CUNK* service programs require *UNK* , *UNKING* , training and *UNKION* -- all of high quality . STOP
They involve *UNKS* to participants . STOP
*CUNK-* residential programs also require housing and *UNK-* *UNKION* ; they are particularly expensive -- more per *UNK* than a year at *CUNK* or Yale . STOP
*CUNKAL* programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 a year . STOP
Are they worth that ? STOP
*CUNKS* suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted . STOP
But the calculations are *UNK* . STOP
5 . *CUNKS* youth are a special concern . STOP
Are such expenditures *UNK* , then ? STOP
*CUNK* , if targeted . STOP
People of all *UNKS* and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for *UNKS* kids , and their *UNKS* , to serve at little public cost . STOP
They can *UNKER* at any of thousands of *UNK-* institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by *UNKS* or employers . STOP
*CUNKS* youth do n't have those opportunities . STOP
They are not *UNKED* in high school or college . STOP
They are unlikely to be employed . STOP
And they have grown up in *UNKLY* *UNK* circumstances , among family structures breaking down , *UNKED* by *UNK-* *UNKS* and bleak prospects . STOP
But many of them can be quite *UNKLY* *UNKED* by *UNK* and *UNKED* service . STOP
Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons . STOP
But some whom nothing else is reaching are *UNKED* . STOP
*CUNKING* skills , producing something *UNKLY* , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them . STOP
Even if it is cheaper to build *UNKS* or *UNK* apartments or plant *UNKS* with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the *UNKION* . STOP
*CUNKLY* *UNKING* , these youth are not performing service . STOP
They are giving up no income , *UNKING* no *UNKS* , *UNKING* no risk . STOP
But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future . STOP
That is a service to the nation . STOP
It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve . STOP
Mr. *CUNK* , a Carter administration budget official , heads his own *CUNKED* strategic planning firm . STOP
He is a *UNK-* of `` National Service : What *CUNK* It *CUNK* ? '' STOP

Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market *UNK* -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet . STOP
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the *UNKS* , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to *UNK* massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis . STOP
And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while *CUNK* Secretary David *CUNKS* carefully *UNKED* data on the Friday market plunge . STOP
But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market *UNKS* . STOP
In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that *UNKING* *UNK* actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's *UNK* . STOP
`` The *UNK* at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on *UNK* . STOP
The Fed 's efforts at *UNK* were partly *UNKED* Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington *CUNK* carried stories *UNKING* a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to *UNK* cash into the banking system Monday morning . STOP
Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to *UNK* sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment . STOP
Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably *UNK* *UNKS* of the central bank 's game plan . STOP
It is prepared to assume the same role it played in October 1987 , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system *UNK* . STOP
The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions . STOP
The *UNK* of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on ABC 's `` This *CUNK* . '' STOP
`` Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact . STOP
I 'm sure they 'll do what 's right , what 's *UNK* , what 's *UNK* , '' he said . STOP
When it was suggested his comment was a `` *UNKER* , '' Mr. Darman *UNKED* : `` It is a *UNKER* . STOP
But , in this context , that 's the smart thing to do . '' STOP
At the Treasury , Secretary Brady issued a statement *UNKING* the stock market 's drop . STOP
`` Today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , '' he said . STOP
`` The economy remains *UNKED* , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . '' STOP
But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week . STOP
`` One possibility is that this is a *UNKAL* setback , reasonably limited in its *UNK* , and not a major problem , '' said one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named . STOP
`` The other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago . STOP
I think that 's less likely . '' STOP
Nevertheless , Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening , monitoring events as they *UNKED* in markets around the world . STOP
The action was expected to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe . STOP
Both the Treasury and the Fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments . STOP
In Tokyo , share prices dropped sharply by 1.7 % in early Monday morning trading . STOP
After the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower . STOP
In the Bush administration , the lead is being taken by Treasury Secretary Brady , *CUNK* Robert *CUNKER* and *CUNK* Secretary *CUNKS* . STOP
The three men worked together on the so-called Brady Commission , headed by Mr. Brady , which was established after the 1987 crash to examine the market 's collapse . STOP
As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market *UNKS* . STOP
Mr. Brady was at the White House Friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began . STOP
He was quickly on the phone with Mr. *CUNKS* , who in turn was talking with the *UNK* of the New York and Chicago exchanges . STOP
Later , Mr. Brady *UNKED* Mr. Greenspan , SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in New York and overseas . STOP
*CUNKS* say he continued to work the phones through the weekend . STOP
Administration officials say President Bush was *UNKED* throughout Friday afternoon and evening , even after leaving for *CUNK* David . STOP
He had frequent telephone *UNKS* with Mr. Brady and Michael *CUNK* , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers . STOP
Government officials tried throughout the weekend to *UNKER* a *UNKAL* appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic . STOP
Treasury *CUNK* David *CUNK* , for instance , was at a meeting of the Business Council in *CUNK* Springs , Va. , when the stock market fell , and remained there through the following day . STOP
And as of last night , Fed Chairman Greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the American Bankers Association convention in Washington at 10 a.m. this morning . STOP
*CUNKLY* , Mr. Greenspan was scheduled to address the same convention in Dallas on Oct. 20 , 1987 . STOP
He flew to Dallas on Oct. 19 , when the market plummeted *UNKN* points , but then turned around the next morning and returned to Washington without *UNKING* his speech . STOP

*CUNK* the urge to call your broker and sell all your stocks . STOP
That 's the advice of most investment professionals after Friday 's 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . STOP
No one can say for sure what will happen today . STOP
And investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months . STOP
But they 're nearly *OUS* on one point : Do n't sell into a panic . STOP
Investors who sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived to *UNK* it . STOP
Even after Friday 's plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 48 % above where it *UNKED* on Oct. 19 two years ago . STOP
*CUNK* selling also was *UNUNK* during other big declines in the past . STOP
The crash of *UNKN* was followed by a substantial recovery before the great *CUNKION* and awful bear market of the 1930s began . STOP
The `` October *UNKS* '' of 1978 and 1979 were *UNK* , but did n't lead to severe or sustained *UNKS* . STOP
Indeed , some pros see Friday 's plunge , plus any further damage that might occur early this week , as a chance for bargain *UNKING* . STOP
`` There has been a lot of emotional selling that *UNKS* a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash , '' says Stephen B. *CUNKS* , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc . STOP
But most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand *UNK* . STOP
`` When you see a *UNK* train , '' says Steve *CUNK* , partner in the San Francisco investment advisory firm *CUNKER* & *CUNK* , `` you wait for the train to stop . '' STOP
Even for people who expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market *UNKS* do -- the advice is : *CUNK* for the market to *UNK* back , and sell shares gradually during rallies . STOP
The best thing individual investors can do is `` just sit tight , '' says Marshall B. *CUNK* , executive vice president and head of investment *UNKING* at Stein *CUNK* & *CUNK* Inc. , a Chicago-based investment *UNKING* firm that manages about $ 18 billion . STOP
On the one hand , Mr. *CUNK* says , it would be *UNKED* to sell into `` a classic panic . '' STOP
On the other hand , it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy . STOP
`` This is all *UNKION* right now , and when *UNKION* starts to run , it can run further than anyone anticipates , '' he said . STOP
`` So it 's more *UNK* to wait and see how things stabilize . '' STOP
Roger *CUNK* , professor of finance at Yale University and head of the market information firm *CUNK* Associates Inc. , says , `` My real advice would be to just ride through it . STOP
*CUNKLY* , it is n't *UNK* to be in and out '' of the stock market . STOP
Mr. *CUNK* thinks that this week is `` going to be a *UNKER* week . '' STOP
But he also thinks it is `` a good week to consider buying . '' STOP
John *CUNKER* , former president of the Los Angeles *UNKER* of the National Association of Investors Corp. , an organization of investment *UNKS* and individual investors , says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of 1987 , and see no reason to sell now . STOP
`` We 're *UNKED* long-term investors , not traders , '' he says . STOP
`` We understand *UNKS* and *UNK* . STOP
And we hope to take advantage of *UNKS* and buy stocks when they plunge . '' STOP
One *UNK* of investment pros sees what happened Friday as an opportunity . STOP
Over the next days and weeks , they say , investors should look for stocks to buy . STOP
Friday 's action `` was an *UNKED* panic , '' says Alfred Goldman , director of technical market analysis for *CUNK* Edwards & Sons in St. Louis . STOP
`` Stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price . '' STOP
His advice : `` You ought to be there with a basket *UNKING* them . '' STOP
James Craig , portfolio manager for the *CUNKED* *CUNKS* Fund , which has one of the industry 's better track records , started his buying during Friday 's plunge . STOP
Stocks such as *CUNK* Foods Corp. , *CUNK-* Stores Inc. , American International Group Inc. and Federal National Mortgage Association became such *UNKS* that he could n't *UNK* them , he says . STOP
And Mr. Craig expects to pick up more shares today . STOP
`` It will be *UNK* at first , but I would not be buying if I thought we were headed for real trouble , '' he says . STOP
He argues that stocks are reasonably valued now , and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of 1987 . STOP
Mr. *CUNK* of Stein *CUNK* suggests that any buying should `` concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side , or stocks that have been *UNK* down a lot more than the market in this correction . '' STOP
His firm favors selected computer , drug and *UNK-* stocks . STOP
Other investment pros are more pessimistic . STOP
They say investors should sell stocks -- but not necessarily right away . STOP
Many of them stress that the selling can be *UNKLY* , *UNKAL* , and done when stock prices are *UNKING* . STOP
On Thursday , William *CUNK* , a Seattle money manager , used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline . STOP
He thinks the underlying inflation rate is around 5 % to 6 % , far higher than most people *UNK* . STOP
In the pension accounts he manages , Mr. *CUNK* has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge . STOP
He thinks government officials are *UNKED* to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high . STOP
So he thinks the government will *UNK* on the side of *UNKED* inflation . STOP
As a result , Mr. *CUNK* says , `` I think the *UNK* game 's over , '' and investors are about to face a bear market . STOP
David M. Jones , vice president at *CUNK* G. *CUNK* & Co. , recommends Treasury securities -LRB- of up to five years ' maturity -RRB- . STOP
He says the Oct. 6 employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to investors . STOP
One strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their *UNKS* is to buy `` put '' options , either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index . STOP
A put option gives its holder the right -LRB- but not the obligation -RRB- to sell a stock -LRB- or stock index -RRB- for a specified price -LRB- the strike price -RRB- until the option expires . STOP
Whether this insurance is *UNK* depends on the cost of an option . STOP
The cost , or premium , tends to get fat in times of crisis . STOP
Thus , buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk . STOP
The prices of puts generally did n't soar Friday . STOP
For example , the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on Eli Lilly & Co. moved up from 3 % at Thursday 's close to only 3.3 % at Friday 's close , even though the shares dropped more than $ *UNKN* . STOP
But *UNKION* prices may *UNK* when trading *UNKS* today . STOP
It 's hard to *UNK* about a reasonable price for puts . STOP
But investors should keep in mind , before paying too much , that the average annual return for stock holdings , long-term , is 9 % to 10 % a year ; a return of 15 % is considered *UNK* . STOP
*CUNKING* , say , 10 % for insurance against losses takes a deep *UNK* out of the return . STOP

*CUNK* *CUNKER* Commercial Group said it sold $ 47 million of common stock to its employees at $ 10 a share , giving them a total stake of more than 40 % in the commercial real estate brokerage firm . STOP
The firm , which was acquired in April from Sears , Roebuck & Co. in a *UNKED* buy-out , had planned to sell up to $ *UNKN* million of stock , or a 50 % stake in the company , to its 5,000 employees . STOP
Though the offering did n't sell out , James J. *CUNKION* , chairman and chief executive officer , said , `` We 're pretty *UNK* of the employees ' response . '' STOP
He noted that unlike an employee stock ownership plan , where a company usually *UNKS* money from third party lenders to buy stock that it sets aside to award employees over time , here employees had to *UNK* out their own cash for the stock . STOP
`` They came up with their own money instead of borrowed money , '' Mr. *CUNKION* said . STOP
`` It 's totally different . '' STOP
He said the offering was designed to create long-term incentives for employees . STOP
`` We 're in a service business , and in that context , it 's *UNKAL* to have your employees involved in the ownership so they have a stake in the success . '' STOP
The brokerage firm wo n't pay a dividend on the stock . STOP
*CUNKS* have the right to trade stock among themselves , and the company will establish an internal clearing house for these transactions . STOP
They may also eventually sell the shares to third parties , but the outside investors who own the remaining 60 % of *CUNK* *CUNKER* have the right to first *UNKAL* . STOP
Those outside investors in *CUNK* *CUNKER* include *CUNK* Group , a closely held Washington , D.C. , merchant banking firm whose *UNK-* is Frank *CUNK* , former secretary of defense ; *CUNK* V. *CUNK* , senior adviser to *CUNK* Group ; Mellon Family Trust of Pittsburgh ; Westinghouse Credit Corp. , the financial services unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp. ; Bankers Trust Co. , a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp. ; and a group of Japanese investors represented by the investment banking unit of *CUNKED* *CUNK* Bank .

The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and futures trading may be a *UNK* at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . STOP
Under a reform *UNKING* from the 1987 crash , trading in the Merc 's stock-index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and *UNKS* five points from Friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average . STOP
The aim of the *UNKION* would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange , which would be *UNKED* by such a volatile move on the Merc . STOP
That *UNKING* *UNKER* is just one of a number of *UNKS* adopted after the 1987 crash . STOP
The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge *UNKS* in trading volume . STOP
Several of those *UNK-* changes *UNKED* in during Friday 's *UNK-* collapse and worked as expected , even though they did n't prevent a *UNKING* plunge . STOP
But the major `` circuit breakers '' have yet to be *UNKED* . STOP
A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test . STOP
A further slide also would *UNK* debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not *UNKED* -- after the last crash . STOP
Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady *CUNK* Force , which *UNKED* the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary . STOP
The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single *UNKING* regulator to handle crucial *UNK-* questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets . STOP
But for the moment , attention *UNKS* on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended . STOP
